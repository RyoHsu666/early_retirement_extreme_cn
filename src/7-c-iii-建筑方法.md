Many  rely  on  their  connection  to  the  market,  through  employment  and
purchasing, to satisfy most of their needs and wants. 

很多人依赖于它们和市场间的联系，通过雇佣和消费来满足他们大多数的需要和想要。

While this makes sense in
some situations--for instance, building your own microwave oven from scratch
would  take  a  lot  of  time48--it  makes  less  sense  in  many  other  cases  (see  A
Renaissance  lifestyle). 

这在一些情况下有意义，比如，从零开始构建你自己的微波炉需要花费大量的时间，这在很多情况下是没有意义的（参见一个文艺复兴式的生活方式）。

 In  some  cases,  purchasing  is  even  used  to  substitute,
usually unsuccessfully, for other needs like recognition, meaning in one's life,
self-worth, and even using and doing things (recreational shopping). 

在一些情况，花钱甚至用于替代像是认可的需求，这通常是不成功的替代，意味着在一个人的生活里，消费意味着自我价值，甚至是在做事情（重新创造购物）。

Using the
market  to  satisfy  every  need  is  expensive  because  the  market  solution  is
generally not the optimal solution.

使用市场来满足需求通常是昂贵的，因为市场的解决方案通常不是最优解。

Often,  consumer  products  come  with  superfluous  frills  (side  effects)  that
don't provide the desired utility.

经常，消费产品附带花哨的虚饰（侧面影响），这不能提供预期的效用。

 Such products waste money and take up space
and  time.  

这样的产品指示花钱占据空间和时间。

The  challenge  is  thus  to  distinguish  between  the  need  (for
example, keeping warm) and the frills (for example, keeping the entire house
warm) and then find an efficient--that is, economical-solution (for example, wear
warmer  clothing,  be  physically  active,  invite  people  over)  rather  than  buy  an
uneconomical product (for example, central heating).

挑战就是区分需要（例如，保暖）和虚饰（例如，让整个房子暖和），找出有效方法，也就是，经济的解法（例如，穿保暖的衣服，让身体运动，请人来做客），而不是购买不经济的产品（例如，中央供暖系统）。

 One of the most important

aspects of construction is often the most ignored: good raw materials or building
blocks.49 

一个最重要的方面也是最常被遗忘的：好的原始材料或建造模块。

 In  retrospect,  that  some  ignore  the  building  blocks  may  not  be  so
surprising  when  considering  the  discussion  above.  

回顾一下，当考虑当上面讨论的内容，那些被忽略的建造模块可能不会令人感到惊讶。

If  the  building  blocks  are
poorly  chosen,  constructing  any  kind  of  solution  becomes  that  much  harder.

如果建造模块选择很少，建筑任何方案都会变得更难。

Choose  the  right  building  blocks  using  the  guiding  principles  in  Strategic
principles.

选择正确的模块使用战术原则种的指导原则。

Combining wholes/solutions/products out of parts allows for flexibility and
substitutability (see this figure). 

用灵活的和可替代的模块结合成整体/方案/产品（参考这个图）。

Having a product that can't be separated into
parts is bad. 

一个不能拆分成部分的产品不好。

This is obvious when one of the functions on a gadget breaks. 

这在一个小部件损坏后尤为明显。

For
instance,  a  modern  desktop  computer  is  typically  built  out  of  individual,
mutually  compatible  parts  which  can  be  selected  and  replaced  by  the  user.

例如，一个桌面电脑是典型的模块构造，用户可以选择和替换互相兼容的组件。

However, most modern electronics built after the introduction of the integrated
circuit  are  problematic--complexity  which  is  better  outsourced--as  it  is
impossible  for  nonexperts  to  understand  what  is  going  on.  

然而，现在的电子产品由于过度集成带来了问题，复杂性，这让非专业人士很难了解它发生了什么事。

Conversely,
mechanical,  electromechanical,  and  thermomechanical  (engines)  objects  built
out  of  wood  and  metal  are  serviceable  by  intelligent  users  since  their
functionality is apparent by inspection. 

相反，由木头和金属制成的物品，它的机械特性，电子特性和散热特性，能被聪明的用户检查时看出来。

You can see what each part does and thus
you can repair it if it breaks. 

你能看出每个部分怎么样了，它坏了也可以修理。

Also, if a part breaks, a new one can be made.

当然，如果部件坏了，也能制造一个新的。

However, it your product relies on the 8086 chip (a widely used computer chip
which first appeared in 1978), you may have a problem sourcing it these days
and you definitely can't build your own--you are trapped.

然而，如果你的产品依赖8086芯片（自从1978年出现以来，广泛使用的计算机芯片），你想找到替换件就成了问题，你也不能自己做一个，你被陷住了。

Next, consider whether the something has multiple uses. 

接下来，考虑一下某个东西有多重用途。

Does it serve more
than one purpose or can it serve alternate purposes? In particular, can it serve as
one thing first and end up serving as another thing? A wooden spoon turns into
firewood at the end of its serviceable life, for example. Obviously, raw materials
are closer to being able to serve multiple purposes, but even completed products
can have multiple uses.
For example, a computer can act as a media center, whereas a media center
(TV+stereo+cable box) can't act as a computer. This isn't strictly a technology
issue. Can any given shirt in your wardrobe be combined with any given pair of
pants  and  look  good?  In  the  kitchen,  the  chef's  knife  is  probably  the  most
versatile, after the spoon and the pot--unless you're a vegetarian, in which case a
serrated  utility  knife  is  better,  as  it  doesn't  require  sharpening,  nor  a  cutting
board.  What  are  the  optimal  ways  of  putting  solutions  together  to  find  the
maximum range of use?
Turn  the  problem  on  its  head  by  changing  it.  Instead  of  looking  for
ingredients (blocks) for recipes (instructions), look for recipes for ingredients.
This is strongly facilitated by carrying many recipes--that is, ways to accomplish
something--in your head. This way, the complexity is internalized and becomes a

design  problem  rather  than  being  externalized  as  a  logistical  problem.  For
instance, when shopping for groceries, knowing many recipes by heart allows
one to tailor what's for dinner to whichever loss leaders are on sale, rather than
venturing out with a shopping list and having to buy single missing ingredients.
If  you  only  have  a  hammer,  the  whole  world  becomes  a  nail--the  most
common hammer is in the shape of a credit card. The more myopic the focus on
a particular method, the more difficult the solution, if and only if the focus is on
the wrong method (and it can't be correct all the time, if you only have one). For
example, when tackling an obstacle like a heavy weight, don't remain confined
to seeking out ways to make the weight lighter. A different solution is to become
stronger. Changing the focus is similar to changing the problem, except in the
latter case the idea is to collect many similar methods; when changing the focus,
the idea is to know many different methods.
Most wants are internal, so focusing internally and "doing without" is often a
less  complicated  way  to  solve  a  problem  as  it  mainly  requires  strength  of
character rather than skills or connections. Rendering wants superfluous requires
little technical skill, but it does require motivation and self-discipline. Giving up
wants can be as tough or easy as going on a diet, giving up smoking, or changing
other habits dependent on strength of character. However, doing without is often
thought of as a sacrifice, especially when strongly attached to material comforts.
It's  quickly  realized  (after  about  a  month)  that  happiness  does  not  stem  from
being surrounded by possessions, but that being surrounded by them is the result
of  an  addictive  habit.  Thus,  it  can  be  tremendously  liberating  not  to  "need"
something to be happy.
Since humans need very little, eliminating various wants can go far in terms
of solving problems. Can't afford it? Don't want it! Too complicated? Don't want
it! Reduce and simplify. Reduce and simplify! An entire aesthetic can and has
been formed around this principle, and so the pleasure from following this path
can be as strong as the (previous) pleasure of accumulation. However, as there's
a  point  of  diminishing  returns  to  the  pleasure  of  accumulation,  there's  also  a
point of diminishing returns to the pleasure of giving things up. The optimal
point is somewhere in the middle. It should therefore be kept in mind that while
eliminating problems  can be  a  very good  tool, some  will  be very  tempted  to
make it their only tool, in which case it becomes a hammer for which the whole
world becomes a nail.
Once  you've  developed  a  greater  freedom  to  choose  by  changing  some
"needs" into "wants," you can tailor your wants to areas that are supplied freely
or  at  least  inexpensively.  Much  free  or  almost  free  stuff  comes  from  the
tremendous  amount  of  waste  generated  by  a  culture  where  things  are  being

bought, used once, and then put away in attics, garages, extra bedrooms, and
ultimately the landfill. Methods for getting things for free are social in nature,
relying  on  connections  to  others  (these  days  often  on  the  Internet  with  like-
minded  people),  keeping  track  of  who  has  or  needs  what,  and  making  the
connections, either through donations, swapping, bartering, or lending. Getting
and providing things for free provides value to society insofar as it keeps things
out  of  the  landfill  and  reduces  the  sales  price  of  newly  produced  things.
Providing  things  for  free  provides  value  insofar  as  it  prevents  further
consumption of finite resources and maximizes the use of our productive efforts.
It's somewhat likely that you're only going to use a given item a few times
yourself  too.  Sending  it  along,  thus  instituting  a  kind  of  serial  ownership,
maximizes its total use. Serial ownership creates a form of decentralized library.
While  there  are  websites  which  bring  serial  owners  together,  availability  is
limited since people are free to keep things as long as they wish, and many do
keep their things around, "just in case." Serial ownership can easily be developed
as an attitude simply by selling things once they're no longer in use. To minimize
depreciation  costs,  buy  and  sell  used.  The  total  cost  of  ownership  will  be
minimal. Often things go out of use because they break and the owner doesn't
know how to fix them. Such things can frequently be acquired very cheaply or
for free. Sadly, they're often thrown out immediately, so if you're looking for
broken  things  to  rescue,  you  must  be  vigilant.  Often,  these  things  are  easily
fixable--bicycles with loose brakes and flat tires, lawn mowers with dirty spark
plugs, furniture with loose screws--and a person with a few simple repair skills
can fix them. Repairing many things is surprisingly easy. Most mechanical items
are put together with nuts and bolts and only require a set of the right wrenches
or screwdrivers. Beginners should at the very least be able to replace a broken
part. The trick is to find out which part is broken, but keep using the replacement
method and you will find the right part.
If  you  get  your  networking  and  repair  skills  down,  you'll  find  yourself
buying mostly the missing parts for your solutions and tools to fit them in--buy
tools that last a lifetime and this phase will soon be over. After all, any finished
product can usually be had for free. The most important thing to remember is
that the price of anything is not determined by how much effort went into the
production. If it was, I should be paid as much for writing this book as an actor
gets  for  a  movie.  Nor  does  it  depend  on  the  level  of  specialized  knowledge
required for the job. If it was, I should have earned more than $40,000 per year
after  spending  10  years  to  acquire  what  corresponds  to  a  master's  degree  in
nuclear  physics  and  a  PhD  in  astrophysics,  given  that  you  can  also  earn  this
salary  as  a  toll  booth  operator.  Nor  is  it  determined  by  any  kind  of  inherent

value. If it was, school teachers would be paid more than professional athletes
and bankers. It's strictly determined by how much the seller can get. This took
the  economics  profession  hundreds  of  years  to  figure  out.  Since  there  are
different sellers with different levels of knowledge about their customers, prices
vary.
When  buying  parts,  tools,  as  well  as  new  things,  always  try  to  get  three
different prices across markets (new and used) and time (do prices tend to go up
or down? are they seasonal?) to get an idea of the effective price. Memorize the
prices for anything you buy regularly--parts for food, also known as ingredients,
come to mind. If memory is failing, keep a price diary. Only issue "limit orders"-
-that is, don't buy until the price falls below some predetermined level. Patience
is rewarded more often than not. Let current purchases determine what problem
you're currently solving rather than the other way around; adapt your plans to
what is on sale.
Given  the  price,  consider  whether  it's  worthwhile  to  buy  the  part  or
manufacture  it  yourself.  This  comes  down  to  valuing  your  time  earning  or
otherwise making money versus your time fixing the problem directly. When
buying  products,  you're  paying  for  time,  materials,  and  knowledge.  You
probably  have  plenty  of  time  (you  read  this  far),  materials  (especially  when
bought in bulk) are shockingly inexpensive, and often the knowledge required to
do a job is overestimated. This means that most people do not properly value
their  own  knowledge,  having  been  convinced  that  an  expert  must  always  be
consulted. However, if you can add and subtract, you can do your own taxes; if
you can keep an appointment, you can garden; and, if you can peel a potato and
tell time, you can cook. These days there are plenty of tutorials online and in
books that will teach you how. With just a little experience, the only thing that
will separate your work from that of a professional is that the professional can do
it five times faster than you can do it--the first time.
This means that anything done more than once is worth doing yourself. To
wit, I can cook my favorite food better than a restaurant because I have cooked
this dish more than 100 times, while a professional chef may only make it once
in a while. I can do it cheaper as well, since I work for myself for free. If I have
a  problem  with  the  plumbing  or  a  binding  door,  I  can  get  immediate  service
because I can fix the problem myself. If the problem reappears, I know what the
problem is and I can fix it much faster than calling a plumber or a carpenter.
Once you can make things, you can also provide value to others. The greater the
variety in the things you make, the greater the likelihood that you can contribute
your skills.
Bodging is probably the first step in making things. Not to be confused with

the art of botching, which is the art of screwing things up, bodging is the art of
improvising a working solution using whatever is on-hand. Duct tape comes to
mind. A few people seem to possess this as a natural ability, but for the average
man, bodging has been suppressed by a sea of experts and professionals. The
general  consensus  is  that  now  you  better  get  an  expert  opinion  before  you
engage in almost anything; better yet, just pay the expert and let him do it for
you.  Once  this  mental  constraint  has  been  removed,  it  becomes  possible  to
bodge.
For example, did you know you can remove rust by scrubbing it with a pad
of aluminum foil? I found out on the Internet. Make a pad out of the foil, put
some  light  oil  on  it  and  scrub  away.  Once  you  understand  why  this  works
(aluminum foil is harder than rust but softer than the good metal and even most
paint jobs), you realize that the oil is just there to provide lubrication. You could
use anything, including spit.
For  more  advanced  rust  removal  you  can  use  electrolysis.  While  many
hobbyists and mechanics use this method routinely, most have only seen this in
action  in  a  high  school  or  university  laboratory  and  haven't  thought  that  the
principle could be applied "outside the box" of a laboratory setting. Use a 2Amp
nondigital car battery charger for the electric source and sodium carbonate (also
known as "washing soda"50 or "pH-Upper" or "booster" for your pool) mixed in
water for your electrolyte. Attach the part to be cleaned to the negative clamp
and some piece of scrap iron to the positive clamp. Bodging enters because you
don't  need  to  specifically  use  sodium  carbonate.  You  could  also  use  sodium
bicarbonate,  also  known  as  baking  soda.  The  only  downside  of  sodium
bicarbonate is that it doesn't work as well, but it will work. The concentration of
sodium carbonate doesn't matter very much (more is slightly faster), nor does the
current (higher is slightly faster). If you understand the principle of how ions
move, you'll quickly realize that rust is removed along the line of sight to the
positive clamp. However, you don't need to understand this to observe that it
works.  Just  keep  repeating  to  yourself,  "This  isn't  rocket  science."  However,
bodging requires another skill to be developed--common sense. We have been
educated  to  follow  instructions  because  it  moves  personal  responsibility  one
level of management up. Yet if you're bodging, all responsibility is yours. You
must know what you're doing. Notice that bubbles appear around the negative
clamp. This is hydrogen. Hydrogen is explosive, think "Hindenburg disaster," so
don't use the water in your rust removal setup to extinguish cigarettes and keep it
in a ventilated area. This is common sense. Furthermore, you might think that
ordinary  kitchen  salt  might  make  a  great  electrolyte.  However,  the  chemical
name of kitchen salt is sodium chloride. Since we are bodging we might produce

some unintended consequences. If the ingredients are sodium and chlorine, those
consequences are chlorine gas,51 which was used as a war gas in World War I,
and sodium hydroxide (caustic soda).
From a general knowledge of history and chemistry, it should therefore be
clear that kitchen salt and sparks (from cigarettes or nearby battery chargers)
should  be  avoided.  Also,  don't  stick  your  hands  into  the  conducting  water.
Bodging  doesn't  require  an  advanced  education,  but  it  does  require  a  real
education connecting what you've learned to real-world problems.
It's interesting to note that the more you know, the more likely you are to
worry about the risks of bodging. Yet, the more you know, the more you realize
that often even experts are simply bodging. You may find this comforting or
worrying depending on your personality and how much you know. One problem
with bodging is that it's difficult to tell whether someone is winging it or actually
knows what they are doing. A good way to tell an expert bodger from a pseudo-
expert is to see if the bodger understands why he is doing something a particular
way. If he mentions "beliefs," "authority," "others," etc., chances are good that he
is winging it for personal gain. Be honest about yourself. If you can't bodge,
delay the project and work on something easier until you can.
Bodging  transitions  smoothly  into  fixing  things.  Fixing  things,  or  rather
parts,  eventually  transitions  into  creating  parts.  First  you'll  be  creating
replacement parts, but eventually you'll be creating your own parts. At this point
you'll thoroughly understand the technology you're using and be ready to make
your own custom-made tools to solve problems.
This  way  of  learning  differentiates  itself  from  the  educational  system
because  it  is  real  learning--that  is,  learning  by  doing  rather  than  learning  by
taking notes, passing tests, and getting degrees. When I, having gone through the
latter  process,  talked  to  people  about  how  they  learned  to  fix  engines,  I  was
surprised to learn that very often they had never taken a course. The typical story
was that at some point they had gotten a broken engine and simply tinkered with
it until it worked.
Each new method requires further development of skill, and you may find
yourself transitioning through different stages depending on your other skills and
personality. At any point in time, one stage may dominate your thinking since
few  will  be  able  to  develop  all  skills  equally  fast.  Those  with  strength  of
character will seek to change, simplify, and downsize, as it goes well with "doing
without  things."  Once  a  resilient  network  has  been  established,  bartering,
swapping,  and  wheeling  and  dealing  will  become  more  exciting  than
simplifying.  Technical  skills  ultimately  lead  to  creative  pursuits,  building  and
making things and rarely doing without, despite rarely buying anything. In my
case, I quickly found myself cooking my own meals and giving things away and
acquiring others for free, whereas it took me a long time to start a garden and I'm
still learning to fix motors and build furniture. Other journeys may be different.
