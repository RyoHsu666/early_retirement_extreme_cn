Many  rely  on  their  connection  to  the  market,  through  employment  and
purchasing, to satisfy most of their needs and wants. 

很多人依赖于它们和市场间的联系，通过雇佣和消费来满足他们大多数的需要和想要。

While this makes sense in
some situations--for instance, building your own microwave oven from scratch
would  take  a  lot  of  time48--it  makes  less  sense  in  many  other  cases  (see  A
Renaissance  lifestyle). 

这在一些情况下有意义，比如，从零开始构建你自己的微波炉需要花费大量的时间，这在很多情况下是没有意义的（参见一个文艺复兴式的生活方式）。

 In  some  cases,  purchasing  is  even  used  to  substitute,
usually unsuccessfully, for other needs like recognition, meaning in one's life,
self-worth, and even using and doing things (recreational shopping). 

在一些情况，花钱甚至用于替代像是认可的需求，这通常是不成功的替代，意味着在一个人的生活里，消费意味着自我价值，甚至是在做事情（重新创造购物）。

Using the
market  to  satisfy  every  need  is  expensive  because  the  market  solution  is
generally not the optimal solution.

使用市场来满足需求通常是昂贵的，因为市场的解决方案通常不是最优解。

Often,  consumer  products  come  with  superfluous  frills  (side  effects)  that
don't provide the desired utility.

经常，消费产品附带花哨的虚饰（侧面影响），这不能提供预期的效用。

 Such products waste money and take up space
and  time.  

这样的产品指示花钱占据空间和时间。

The  challenge  is  thus  to  distinguish  between  the  need  (for
example, keeping warm) and the frills (for example, keeping the entire house
warm) and then find an efficient--that is, economical-solution (for example, wear
warmer  clothing,  be  physically  active,  invite  people  over)  rather  than  buy  an
uneconomical product (for example, central heating).

挑战就是区分需要（例如，保暖）和虚饰（例如，让整个房子暖和），找出有效方法，也就是，经济的解法（例如，穿保暖的衣服，让身体运动，请人来做客），而不是购买不经济的产品（例如，中央供暖系统）。

 One of the most important

aspects of construction is often the most ignored: good raw materials or building
blocks.49 

一个最重要的方面也是最常被遗忘的：好的原始材料或建造模块。

 In  retrospect,  that  some  ignore  the  building  blocks  may  not  be  so
surprising  when  considering  the  discussion  above.  

回顾一下，当考虑当上面讨论的内容，那些被忽略的建造模块可能不会令人感到惊讶。

If  the  building  blocks  are
poorly  chosen,  constructing  any  kind  of  solution  becomes  that  much  harder.

如果建造模块选择很少，建筑任何方案都会变得更难。

Choose  the  right  building  blocks  using  the  guiding  principles  in  Strategic
principles.

选择正确的模块使用战术原则种的指导原则。

Combining wholes/solutions/products out of parts allows for flexibility and
substitutability (see this figure). 

用灵活的和可替代的模块结合成整体/方案/产品（参考这个图）。

Having a product that can't be separated into
parts is bad. 

一个不能拆分成部分的产品不好。

This is obvious when one of the functions on a gadget breaks. 

这在一个小部件损坏后尤为明显。

For
instance,  a  modern  desktop  computer  is  typically  built  out  of  individual,
mutually  compatible  parts  which  can  be  selected  and  replaced  by  the  user.

例如，一个桌面电脑是典型的模块构造，用户可以选择和替换互相兼容的组件。

However, most modern electronics built after the introduction of the integrated
circuit  are  problematic--complexity  which  is  better  outsourced--as  it  is
impossible  for  nonexperts  to  understand  what  is  going  on.  

然而，现在的电子产品由于过度集成带来了问题，复杂性，这让非专业人士很难了解它发生了什么事。

Conversely,
mechanical,  electromechanical,  and  thermomechanical  (engines)  objects  built
out  of  wood  and  metal  are  serviceable  by  intelligent  users  since  their
functionality is apparent by inspection. 

相反，由木头和金属制成的物品，它的机械特性，电子特性和散热特性，能被聪明的用户检查时看出来。

You can see what each part does and thus
you can repair it if it breaks. 

你能看出每个部分怎么样了，它坏了也可以修理。

Also, if a part breaks, a new one can be made.

当然，如果部件坏了，也能制造一个新的。

However, it your product relies on the 8086 chip (a widely used computer chip
which first appeared in 1978), you may have a problem sourcing it these days
and you definitely can't build your own--you are trapped.

然而，如果你的产品依赖8086芯片（自从1978年出现以来，广泛使用的计算机芯片），你想找到替换件就成了问题，你也不能自己做一个，你被陷住了。

Next, consider whether the something has multiple uses. 

接下来，考虑一下某个东西有多重用途。

Does it serve more
than one purpose or can it serve alternate purposes? In particular, can it serve as
one thing first and end up serving as another thing? A wooden spoon turns into
firewood at the end of its serviceable life, for example. 

它能用于一个用途还是他能用于其他用途？特别的，它能先用于一种用途退役时用作其他东西？例如，一个木头勺子在它寿终正寝时可以做烧火柴。

Obviously, raw materials
are closer to being able to serve multiple purposes, but even completed products
can have multiple uses.

很明显，原始材料最接近多用途目的，但有一些完整的产品也能用于多用途。

For example, a computer can act as a media center, whereas a media center
(TV+stereo+cable box) can't act as a computer.

例如，电脑能作为媒体中心使用，而媒体中心（电视 + 音响 + 线缆盒子）不能当作电脑使用。

 This isn't strictly a technology
issue.

这不是一个严格的技术问题。

 Can any given shirt in your wardrobe be combined with any given pair of
pants  and  look  good? 

你衣柜里的任何衬衫能和任何裤子搭配起来好看吗？

 In  the  kitchen,  the  chef's  knife  is  probably  the  most
versatile, after the spoon and the pot--unless you're a vegetarian, in which case a
serrated  utility  knife  is  better,  as  it  doesn't  require  sharpening,  nor  a  cutting
board. 

厨房里，厨刀可能时用途最广泛的了，之后是勺子和锅，除非你是素食主义者，那样的话锯齿刀更好，不锯木板的话，它都不需要磨。

 What  are  the  optimal  ways  of  putting  solutions  together  to  find  the
maximum range of use?
Turn  the  problem  on  its  head  by  changing  it.  

什么是找到最大程度使用的最优化的方法？

Instead  of  looking  for
ingredients (blocks) for recipes (instructions), look for recipes for ingredients.

和找到食谱（建筑）的佐料（模块）相比，找到佐料的食谱。


This is strongly facilitated by carrying many recipes--that is, ways to accomplish
something--in your head.

携带大量的食谱会是很强的帮助，那就是，你头脑里有完成一些事情的方法。

 This way, the complexity is internalized and becomes a

design  problem  rather  than  being  externalized  as  a  logistical  problem. 

这在方法下，复杂是内在的设计问题，而不是外在的逻辑问题。

 For
instance, when shopping for groceries, knowing many recipes by heart allows
one to tailor what's for dinner to whichever loss leaders are on sale, rather than
venturing out with a shopping list and having to buy single missing ingredients.

例如，当买杂货时，心里知道很多食谱的话，一个人就会购买打折的商品做晚餐，而不是列出一个购物清单，对照着买每样东西。

If  you  only  have  a  hammer,  the  whole  world  becomes  a  nail--the  most
common hammer is in the shape of a credit card.

如果你只有一把锤子，整个世界都会变成钉子，最常见的锤子是信用卡。

 The more myopic the focus on
a particular method, the more difficult the solution, if and only if the focus is on
the wrong method (and it can't be correct all the time, if you only have one). 

越近视地聚焦于特别的方法，解决方案越困难，这其实是聚焦在错误的方法上（如果你只有一个方法，它不可能一直正确）。

For
example, when tackling an obstacle like a heavy weight, don't remain confined
to seeking out ways to make the weight lighter.

例如，当处理一个像很重的障碍物，不要局限于找出让重量轻一点的方法。

 A different solution is to become
stronger.

困难的方法是变强壮。

 Changing the focus is similar to changing the problem, except in the
latter case the idea is to collect many similar methods; 

改变聚焦点和改变问题是相同的，除了后面的情况，想法都是收集很多相同的方法；

when changing the focus,
the idea is to know many different methods.

当改变了聚焦点，想法是了解很多不同的方法。

Most wants are internal, so focusing internally and "doing without" is often a
less  complicated  way  to  solve  a  problem  as  it  mainly  requires  strength  of
character rather than skills or connections. 

很多欲望都是内部的，所以聚焦内部和“没有条件”是简单解决问题的方法，因为它主要要求的是性格而不是技巧和联系。

Rendering wants superfluous requires
little technical skill, but it does require motivation and self-discipline. 

呈现欲望多余的要求一点技术技能，但是它要求动机和自律。

Giving up
wants can be as tough or easy as going on a diet, giving up smoking, or changing
other habits dependent on strength of character. 

放弃欲望能很难也可以很简单，就像节食，戒烟，或者改变习惯，这依赖于坚强的性格。

However, doing without is often
thought of as a sacrifice, especially when strongly attached to material comforts.

然而，“没有条件”经常被认为是牺牲，当它被和精神满足联系时尤其强烈。

It's  quickly  realized  (after  about  a  month)  that  happiness  does  not  stem  from
being surrounded by possessions, but that being surrounded by them is the result
of  an  addictive  habit.  

这让人快速认识到（过了大约一个月）幸福不是被物质包围刺激产生的，而是被它们包围是一种上瘾的习惯。

Thus,  it  can  be  tremendously  liberating  not  to  "need"
something to be happy.

也是就，不“需要”什么东西就能幸福，幸福就能够被戏剧性地解放。

Since humans need very little, eliminating various wants can go far in terms
of solving problems. 

排除掉目前为止多种的欲望，人类只需要很少一点东西就能解决问题。

Can't afford it?

无法承担它？

 Don't want it! 
 
 不想要它！
 
 Too complicated? Don't want
it! 

太过复杂？不想要它！

Reduce and simplify. Reduce and simplify!

简化。简化！

 An entire aesthetic can and has
been formed around this principle, and so the pleasure from following this path
can be as strong as the (previous) pleasure of accumulation. 

整个的审美可以围绕着这个原则形成，跟随这个路径的满足会是非常强烈的满足积累。

However, as there's
a  point  of  diminishing  returns  to  the  pleasure  of  accumulation,  there's  also  a
point of diminishing returns to the pleasure of giving things up. 

然而，这有一个削减回馈满足积累的点，也有削弱放弃事物满足回馈的点。

The optimal
point is somewhere in the middle.

最有的点是在中间的某个地方。

 It should therefore be kept in mind that while
eliminating problems  can be  a  very good  tool, some  will  be very  tempted  to
make it their only tool, in which case it becomes a hammer for which the whole
world becomes a nail.

需要铭记于心的是，消灭问题能是一个非常好的工具，一些人会把它当作唯一的工具，在这在情况下，它就变成了锤子，整个世界变成了钉子。

Once  you've  developed  a  greater  freedom  to  choose  by  changing  some
"needs" into "wants," you can tailor your wants to areas that are supplied freely
or  at  least  inexpensively. 

一旦你开发出了一个更大的选择自由度，把“需要”转变成“想要”，你就可以把你的想要修补成免费的供应或至少是不昂贵的。

 Much  free  or  almost  free  stuff  comes  from  the
tremendous  amount  of  waste  generated  by  a  culture  where  things  are  being

bought, used once, and then put away in attics, garages, extra bedrooms, and
ultimately the landfill. 

如此多免费或近似免费的东西来自大量的浪费，这由我们的现代文化产生，东西被买来，用一次，然后把它们丢弃到阁楼，车库，额外的卧室，最终，扔到垃圾场。

Methods for getting things for free are social in nature,
relying  on  connections  to  others  (these  days  often  on  the  Internet  with  like-
minded  people),  keeping  track  of  who  has  or  needs  what,  and  making  the
connections, either through donations, swapping, bartering, or lending.

免费获取东西自然的方法是社交，依赖和他人的联系（现在经常是互联网思维的人们），跟踪谁有和谁有需要，通过捐赠，交换，改造和租借建立起连接。

 Getting
and providing things for free provides value to society insofar as it keeps things
out  of  the  landfill  and  reduces  the  sales  price  of  newly  produced  things.

目前为止，提供免费的东西给社会带来的价值是不让有用的东西进垃圾场，也减少了新产品的价格。

Providing  things  for  free  provides  value  insofar  as  it  prevents  further
consumption of finite resources and maximizes the use of our productive efforts.

提供免费东西的价值是阻止了无限的资源消耗和最大化产品的价值。

It's somewhat likely that you're only going to use a given item a few times
yourself  too. 

最有可能的是，你也只会用几次别人给你的东西。

 Sending  it  along,  thus  instituting  a  kind  of  serial  ownership,
maximizes its total use.

把它送走，就是一种形式的串行使用权，着最大化了事物的总用量。

 Serial ownership creates a form of decentralized library.

串行使用权创造了一种去中心化的图书馆。

While  there  are  websites  which  bring  serial  owners  together,  availability  is
limited since people are free to keep things as long as they wish, and many do
keep their things around, "just in case." 

有一些网站能把串行的拥有者几乎到以前，运行人们愿意多久就多久持有物品的自由，让他们把东西放身边“以防万一”。

Serial ownership can easily be developed
as an attitude simply by selling things once they're no longer in use.

把不再使用的东西卖掉，作为一种态度，串行所有权能能被非常简单地开发出来。

 To minimize
depreciation  costs,  buy  and  sell  used. 

买入然后用完卖掉，这最小化了折旧价格。

 The  total  cost  of  ownership  will  be
minimal.

总的持有成本被最小化了。

 Often things go out of use because they break and the owner doesn't
know how to fix them. 

经常，东西坏了以后就不再用了，因为拥有者不知道如何修理它。

Such things can frequently be acquired very cheaply or
for free.

这些东西经常能非常便宜或者免费地获取。

 Sadly, they're often thrown out immediately, so if you're looking for
broken  things  to  rescue,  you  must  be  vigilant. 

不幸的是，这些东西经常被直接扔掉，如果你想找坏的东西修好，你必须机警点。

 Often,  these  things  are  easily
fixable--bicycles with loose brakes and flat tires, lawn mowers with dirty spark
plugs, furniture with loose screws--and a person with a few simple repair skills
can fix them. 

经常，这些东西非常好修，刹车松了和没气了的自行车，火花塞积炭了的除草机，螺丝松了的家具，稍微有点维修技能的人都能把它修好。

 Repairing many things is surprisingly easy. 
 
 很多东西维修起来都异常简单。
 
 Most mechanical items
are put together with nuts and bolts and only require a set of the right wrenches
or screwdrivers. 

很多机械设备只需要合适的板子和改锥，用螺丝和螺母把它们组装到一起。

Beginners should at the very least be able to replace a broken
part. 

初学者应该至少能替换坏了的部分。

The trick is to find out which part is broken, but keep using the replacement
method and you will find the right part.

挑战是找出哪里坏了，不断使用替换法你就能找出那块坏了。

If  you  get  your  networking  and  repair  skills  down,  you'll  find  yourself
buying mostly the missing parts for your solutions and tools to fit them in--buy
tools that last a lifetime and this phase will soon be over.

如果你拥有网络和维修技能，你会发现你只是在买缺失的部分和合适的工具，购买工具会持续一段时间，然后这个阶段很快就结束了。

 After all, any finished
product can usually be had for free. 

这以后，任何完成了的产品通常免费的。

The most important thing to remember is
that the price of anything is not determined by how much effort went into the
production.

最重要的事情是牢记，物品的价格不是由向产品中投入多少精力决定的。

 If it was, I should be paid as much for writing this book as an actor
gets  for  a  movie. 

如果是这样，我写这本书应该和电影演员收入一样多。

 Nor  does  it  depend  on  the  level  of  specialized  knowledge
required for the job.

也不取决于这项工作的知识专业度。

 If it was, I should have earned more than $40,000 per year
after  spending  10  years  to  acquire  what  corresponds  to  a  master's  degree  in
nuclear  physics  and  a  PhD  in  astrophysics,  given  that  you  can  also  earn  this
salary  as  a  toll  booth  operator. 

如果是这样，我应该赚的比4万刀每年，因为我花了10年时间获得了核物理和天体物理博士，这给的和一个收费站的操作员是一样的收入。

 Nor  is  it  determined  by  any  kind  of  inherent

value. 

也不取决于某种内在的价值。

 If it was, school teachers would be paid more than professional athletes
and bankers. 

如果是这样，学校的老师会比职业运动员和银行家工资更高。

It's strictly determined by how much the seller can get.

它只取决于销售人员能获得多少。

 This took
the  economics  profession  hundreds  of  years  to  figure  out.  

弄明白这个原理花费了经济学专业人士花了数百年时间。

Since  there  are
different sellers with different levels of knowledge about their customers, prices
vary.

因为不同的销售对他们顾客知识层次是不同的，价格也就出现了变化。

When  buying  parts,  tools,  as  well  as  new  things,  always  try  to  get  three
different prices across markets (new and used) and time (do prices tend to go up
or down? are they seasonal?) to get an idea of the effective price. 

当购买组件，工具的时候，买新东西的时候也一样，总是尝试货比三家（新的和二手的）和价格走势（价格走高还是走低？价格是不是有季节性？），来得到有效价格的新想法。

Memorize the
prices for anything you buy regularly--parts for food, also known as ingredients,
come to mind. 

记住你经常购买的东西的价格。

If memory is failing, keep a price diary.

如果记不住，计到笔记本上。

 Only issue "limit orders"-
-that is, don't buy until the price falls below some predetermined level.

唯一的问题就是“限制买单”，也就是，如果价格没掉到预期的水平下就不买。

 Patience
is rewarded more often than not. 

耐心通常会获得回报。

Let current purchases determine what problem
you're currently solving rather than the other way around; adapt your plans to
what is on sale.

让当前的购物决定你当前正在解决的问题而不是其他方法；适配你的计划到什么正在卖。


Given  the  price,  consider  whether  it's  worthwhile  to  buy  the  part  or
manufacture  it  yourself.  

对于给定价格，考虑它是值得购买还是自己制作。

This  comes  down  to  valuing  your  time  earning  or
otherwise making money versus your time fixing the problem directly. 

这就变成了你的时间更值钱还是花时间解决问题更值钱。

When
buying  products,  you're  paying  for  time,  materials,  and  knowledge.  

当你购买产品的时候，你花费了时间，材料和知识。

You
probably  have  plenty  of  time  (you  read  this  far),  materials  (especially  when
bought in bulk) are shockingly inexpensive, and often the knowledge required to
do a job is overestimated. 

你可能有大量的时间（你都读到这里了），材料（特别是批量购买）都是惊人的便宜，而且完成工作的知识经常被过高估计。

This means that most people do not properly value
their  own  knowledge,  having  been  convinced  that  an  expert  must  always  be
consulted. 

这意味着大多数人没有自我知识的正确评估，认为需要向专家请教。

However, if you can add and subtract, you can do your own taxes; if
you can keep an appointment, you can garden; and, if you can peel a potato and
tell time, you can cook. 

然而，如果你能做加减法，你就能给自己报税；如果你能守约，你就能做园艺；如果你能削番茄和计时，你就能做饭。

These days there are plenty of tutorials online and in
books that will teach you how.

如今网上有大量的教程教你怎么做。

 With just a little experience, the only thing that
will separate your work from that of a professional is that the professional can do
it five times faster than you can do it--the first time.

只需要一点点的经验，把你和专家区分开的只是，专家做到比你第一次做快5倍。

This means that anything done more than once is worth doing yourself. 

这就意味着，任何不止做一次的事情都值得自己尝试。

To
wit, I can cook my favorite food better than a restaurant because I have cooked
this dish more than 100 times, while a professional chef may only make it once
in a while.

也就是，我最爱吃的食物，我能比餐馆的厨师做的好，因为这道菜我做了不下100遍了，与此同时厨师长只偶尔做一次。

 I can do it cheaper as well, since I work for myself for free.
 
 我做出来的也便宜，因为我给我自己工作是免费的。
 
  If I have
a  problem  with  the  plumbing  or  a  binding  door,  I  can  get  immediate  service
because I can fix the problem myself.

但是如果我的管道或者门的固定出了问题，我立马获得服务，因为我可以自己修理。

 If the problem reappears, I know what the
problem is and I can fix it much faster than calling a plumber or a carpenter.

如果问题重现，我知道问题是什么，并且我能比找管道工和木工更快修好。

Once you can make things, you can also provide value to others. 

一旦你可以制作东西，你就也能给其他人提供价值。

The greater the
variety in the things you make, the greater the likelihood that you can contribute
your skills.

你制作的东西越多样，你就越有可能提高你的技能。

Bodging is probably the first step in making things. 

简单修补可能是制作东西的第一步。

Not to be confused with

the art of botching, which is the art of screwing things up, bodging is the art of
improvising a working solution using whatever is on-hand. 

拼凑的艺术是把物品固定到一起，修补的艺术是用手头的东西改善解决方案。

Duct tape comes to
mind. 

胶带出现在了脑海。

A few people seem to possess this as a natural ability, but for the average
man, bodging has been suppressed by a sea of experts and professionals.

一少部分人可能自然地掌握这种能力，但平常人，修补被专业人士海洋的淹没。

 The
general  consensus  is  that  now  you  better  get  an  expert  opinion  before  you
engage in almost anything; better yet, just pay the expert and let him do it for
you. 

通用的共识是你在自己处理前最好获得专家的意见；最好，直接付钱给专家让他替你做。

 Once  this  mental  constraint  has  been  removed,  it  becomes  possible  to
bodge.

一旦这种思维定式被移除，修补就变得可能了。


For example, did you know you can remove rust by scrubbing it with a pad
of aluminum foil? I found out on the Internet. Make a pad out of the foil, put
some  light  oil  on  it  and  scrub  away.  

例如，你知道用铝箔能擦除锈迹吗？我从网上找到这个。制作一个铝箔盘，放一点油就可以把锈擦掉。

Once  you  understand  why  this  works
(aluminum foil is harder than rust but softer than the good metal and even most
paint jobs), you realize that the oil is just there to provide lubrication. 

一旦你理解了问什么这能行（铝箔比锈硬比材料软，甚至比喷漆都软），你就明白了油是提供润滑作用的。

You could
use anything, including spit.

你可以使用任何东西，包括唾沫。

For  more  advanced  rust  removal  you  can  use  electrolysis.  

更进一步的除锈方法，你可以使用电解法。

While  many
hobbyists and mechanics use this method routinely, most have only seen this in
action  in  a  high  school  or  university  laboratory  and  haven't  thought  that  the
principle could be applied "outside the box" of a laboratory setting. 

很多爱好者和机械上使用这种方法，很多人只是在高中或者大学实验室里做过这个，没有想过这可以在实验室外应用。

Use a 2Amp
nondigital car battery charger for the electric source and sodium carbonate (also
known as "washing soda"50 or "pH-Upper" or "booster" for your pool) mixed in
water for your electrolyte.

使用一个2A的非数字汽车电池充电器做电影，在水中混入碳酸钠作为电解液。

 Attach the part to be cleaned to the negative clamp
and some piece of scrap iron to the positive clamp. 

把要清洁的部分接到负极，一块铁片接到正极。

Bodging enters because you
don't  need  to  specifically  use  sodium  carbonate.  

你不一定要用碳酸钠。

You  could  also  use  sodium
bicarbonate,  also  known  as  baking  soda. 

可以用碳酸氢钠，也叫做小苏打。

 The  only  downside  of  sodium
bicarbonate is that it doesn't work as well, but it will work. 

碳酸氢钠效果不好，但是也能用。

The concentration of
sodium carbonate doesn't matter very much (more is slightly faster), nor does the
current (higher is slightly faster). 

碳酸钠的浓度不重要（浓度高更快），电流大小也不重要（电流大更快）。

If you understand the principle of how ions
move, you'll quickly realize that rust is removed along the line of sight to the
positive clamp.

如果你理解离子移动的基本原则，你很快就能意识到铁锈随着正电极线性移除。

 However, you don't need to understand this to observe that it
works. 

然而，你不需要理解它这也会工作。

 Just  keep  repeating  to  yourself,  "This  isn't  rocket  science."  
 
只是告诉自己，“这并不是火箭科学。”
 
 However,
bodging requires another skill to be developed--common sense.

但是，修改还需要一个技能——常识。

 We have been
educated  to  follow  instructions  because  it  moves  personal  responsibility  one
level of management up. 

我们都被教导过要遵守指示，因为它把一个人的管理责任提升了一级。

Yet if you're bodging, all responsibility is yours. 

当你改进配方的时候，你担负全部责任。

You
must know what you're doing.

你必须知道你在干啥。

 Notice that bubbles appear around the negative
clamp. 

注意到负电极部分出现了气泡。

This is hydrogen. Hydrogen is explosive, think "Hindenburg disaster," so
don't use the water in your rust removal setup to extinguish cigarettes and keep it
in a ventilated area.

这是氢气。氢气是有爆炸性的，想想“兴登堡灾难”，不要用除锈的装置中点香烟，把它放在通风的环境。

 This is common sense. Furthermore, you might think that
ordinary  kitchen  salt  might  make  a  great  electrolyte.

这是常识。

更进一步，你可能想厨房的食盐可能是不错的电解质。

  However,  the  chemical
name of kitchen salt is sodium chloride. 

然而，食盐化学上的名字是氯化钠。

Since we are bodging we might produce

some unintended consequences. 

因此我们的修改可能会产生一些不想要的产物。

If the ingredients are sodium and chlorine, those
consequences are chlorine gas,51 which was used as a war gas in World War I,
and sodium hydroxide (caustic soda).

如果电解质是纳和氯，产物是氯气，这曾被作为毒气在一战中使用，还有就是氢氧化钠（苛性钠）。

From a general knowledge of history and chemistry, it should therefore be
clear that kitchen salt and sparks (from cigarettes or nearby battery chargers)
should  be  avoided. 

从基本的历史和化学知识出发，食盐和火花（烟头或者临近的电池接触火花）应该避免。

 Also,  don't  stick  your  hands  into  the  conducting  water.

同样，也别把手放到导电的水中。

Bodging  doesn't  require  an  advanced  education,  but  it  does  require  a  real
education connecting what you've learned to real-world problems.

修补不需要进阶的教育，但是需要把教育所学得到和现实的问题结合起来。

It's interesting to note that the more you know, the more likely you are to
worry about the risks of bodging. 

有趣的是，你知道的越多，你担心的风险项越多。

Yet, the more you know, the more you realize
that often even experts are simply bodging. 

当然，你知道的越多，你越意识到专家只是在做简单的修补。

You may find this comforting or
worrying depending on your personality and how much you know.

你会发现这是满意的还是令人担心的取决于你个人能力和你知道多少。

 One problem
with bodging is that it's difficult to tell whether someone is winging it or actually
knows what they are doing.

一个修补的问题是，很难说明一个正在做这个的人是不是知道他们在做什么。

 A good way to tell an expert bodger from a pseudo-
expert is to see if the bodger understands why he is doing something a particular
way. 

一个区别专家还是伪专家的方法是，看他是不是理解他自己的特殊方法。

If he mentions "beliefs," "authority," "others," etc., chances are good that he
is winging it for personal gain. Be honest about yourself. 

如果他提到了“信念”，“权威”，“其他人”等等，他只是在借此增加自身的分量，对自己要诚实。

If you can't bodge,
delay the project and work on something easier until you can.

如果你不能修补，就依靠那些简单到你能做的项目。


Bodging  transitions  smoothly  into  fixing  things. 

修补能平滑地转换成修好。

 Fixing  things,  or  rather
parts,  eventually  transitions  into  creating  parts.

修好或更换部件，甚至能转换成创造部件。

  First  you'll  be  creating
replacement parts, but eventually you'll be creating your own parts.

最开始，你会创造可替换的部件，更进一步你就会创造你自己的部件。

 At this point
you'll thoroughly understand the technology you're using and be ready to make
your own custom-made tools to solve problems.

从这个点上看，你会透彻地理解你使用的技术，准备好制作你自己的工具来解决问题。

This  way  of  learning  differentiates  itself  from  the  educational  system
because  it  is  real  learning--that  is,  learning  by  doing  rather  than  learning  by
taking notes, passing tests, and getting degrees.

这种学习方法不同于教育体现，因为这才是真正的学习，通过实践去学习，而不是通过记笔记，通过考试，获得学历来学习。

 When I, having gone through the
latter  process,  talked  to  people  about  how  they  learned  to  fix  engines,  I  was
surprised to learn that very often they had never taken a course. 

当我开始之后的过程，和人讨论他们如何学会修发动机的，我一直惊讶于他们从没有上过课。

The typical story
was that at some point they had gotten a broken engine and simply tinkered with
it until it worked.

典型的故事是，他们的发动机坏了，他们开始一点点修理，直到修好为止。

Each new method requires further development of skill, and you may find
yourself transitioning through different stages depending on your other skills and
personality.

即使新方法需要更进一步的技能开发，你会发现你不同阶段的转变依赖于你的其他技能和个性。

 At any point in time, one stage may dominate your thinking since
few  will  be  able  to  develop  all  skills  equally  fast.  

从任何时间点上，一个阶段会占据你的思考，一维很少人有能力同等快速地发展所有技能。

Those  with  strength  of
character will seek to change, simplify, and downsize, as it goes well with "doing
without  things." 

那些有人性的会吸收掉改变，简化，缩小，直到它变成“无为而治”。

 Once  a  resilient  network  has  been  established,  bartering,
swapping,  and  wheeling  and  dealing  will  become  more  exciting  than
simplifying. 

一旦一个松散的网络建立起来，重制，交换，交易都会变得非常令人兴奋。

 Technical  skills  ultimately  lead  to  creative  pursuits,  building  and
making things and rarely doing without, despite rarely buying anything. 

技术最终导向创造力，建造和制作东西会几乎不需要买任何东西。

In my
case, I quickly found myself cooking my own meals and giving things away and
acquiring others for free, whereas it took me a long time to start a garden and I'm
still learning to fix motors and build furniture. 

我的例子是，我很快发现我能自己做饭，放弃一些东西，和免费获取一些东西，然而开始园艺却花了我很长时间，我现在仍然在学习修摩托和做家具。

Other journeys may be different.

其他的旅程可能是不同。
