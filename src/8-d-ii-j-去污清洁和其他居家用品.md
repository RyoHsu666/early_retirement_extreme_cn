I prefer to clean appliances and utensils immediately after using them. 

This means that after I'm done using a cutting board or ladle, I clean it immediately. 

Since the food isn't dry yet, this makes it very easy to clean and saves time. 

I try to do the same with general maintenance. 

Dirt and mess tends to invite more dirt and mess, so it's best kept from establishing a foothold in the first place. 

Another popular method is waiting for guests to come over and then engaging in a frantic overhaul of the entire home. 


Most household cleaners comprise simple staple ingredients which you can mix  yourself,  but  which  are  sold  in  fancy  bottles  with  expensive  advertising campaigns  to  an  ignorant  public  for  10  times  the  cost. 

Since  their  basic ingredients are the same, their effectiveness is too. 


The  staples  are  ammonia,  baking  soda,  borax,  chlorine,  soap,  and  clear vinegar. 

Just  remember  to  never  combine  chlorine  and  ammonia. 

Otherwise, learn  how  to  put  the  rest  together,  instead  of  relying  on  companies  to  supply them to you with additives at a higher cost. 

This only requires searching the web for "homemade X" or "DIY X" every time you need X. 

My last search was for oven cleaner; no problem.
