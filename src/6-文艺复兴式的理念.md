A Renaissance man excels in a wide range of subjects. 
文艺复兴时期人擅长广泛的学科。
He is also known as a universal  man,  a  polymath,  or  more  derisively  as  a  jack  of  all  trades. 
他也被称为一个通才，一个博学者，或者更具讽刺意味的是，他是一个杂而不精的人（Jack of all trades, master of none）。
In  our modern,  highly  specialized world,  the  term  jack  of  all  trades  typically  implies master  of  none,  but  the  traditional  Renaissance  man  mastered  one  and  often more subjects while being competent in many subjects. 
在我们这个高度专业化的现代世界中，各行各业的杰克一词通常意味着一事无成，但传统的文艺复兴时期的人精通了一门甚至更多的学科，同时又胜任许多学科。

There is some modern controversy as to what it means to be a polymath, and thus  by  association  what  it  means  to  be  a  Renaissance  man. 
对于博学者意味着什么，以及由此联想到的文艺复兴人意味着什么，现代社会存在着一些争议。
Several  hundred years  ago,  when  the  terms  first  came  into  existence,  the  amount  of  human knowledge  was  still  relatively  minute  and  thus  a  dedicated  person  could eventually  master  many  different  fields  of  knowledge. 
几百年前，当这些术语首次出现时，人类的知识量仍然相对较少，因此一个专心致志的人最终可以掌握许多不同的知识领域。
However,  thanks  to  an immense  number  of  researchers,  the  amount  of  available  information  today  is equally  immense.26  It  is  hard  to  master  even  one  narrowly  scoped  field  of knowledge (see The cost of specialization), let alone two or more. 
然而，多亏了大量的研究人员，今天的可用信息量如此巨大。即使是掌握一个范围狭窄的知识领域（参见[专业化的代价]()）也很难，更不用说掌握两个或更多了。
Some people therefore  claim  that  it  is  impossible  to  be  a  true  polymath  anymore. 
因此，有些人声称不可能再成为一名真正的博学者了。
In  my opinion,  the  modern  ideal  of  a  polymath  should  therefore  not  be  an  absolute measure of mastery in all subjects. 
因此，在我看来，博学者的现代理想不应该是对所有学科精通程度的绝对衡量。
Instead, the objective should be to strive for competence in a range of important subjects. 
相反，我们的目标应该是在一系列重要的学科中获取能力。
Don't worry about whether you can eventually  become  an  expert  (see  Gauging  mastery). 
不要担心你最终能否成为一名专家（参见[衡量精通]()）。
Rather,  try  to  constantly improve on the subjects you already know and seek out useful things to learn. 
相反，试着在你已经知道的科目上不断提高，并寻找有用的东西来学习。

With  a  process-oriented  attitude  you'll  eventually  master  several  subjects. 
以过程为导向的态度，你最终会掌握几门学科。
Once a threshold is reached, the synergy between different subjects will help you create new solutions. 
一旦达到阈值，不同主题之间的协同作用将帮助你创建新的解决方案。
Since all human knowledge is based on a limited number of mental models, the stronger and wider this foundation of models is, the easier it  is  to  gain  new  knowledge. 
由于所有的人类知识都基于有限数量的心智模型，模型的基础越强和越广，就越容易获得新知识。
A  similar  principle  holds  for  physical  abilities, emotional  maturity,  social  networks,  economic  power,  technical  understanding, and one's ability to integrate with the world. 
身体能力、情感成熟度、社交网络、经济实力、技术理解和融入世界的能力也有类似的原则。
Perhaps now more than ever there's a  need  for  people  who  understand  and  are  able  to  connect  different interdisciplinary  topics,  lest  we  end  up  in  a  Tower  of  Babel  situation  where specialists and experts no longer understand each other. 
也许现在，比以往任何时候，都更需要理解并能够连接不同学科主题的人，以免我们最终陷入专家和专家不再相互理解的巴别塔中。

The  ability  to  connect  disparate  fields  or  items  in  complex  ways  and  reach new creative solutions creates paradigm shifts. 
以复杂方式连接不同领域或项目，并达成新的创造性解决方案的能力，创造了范式转变。
It was the universal ideal that led to the discovery of the scientific method, the rediscovery of democracy, and the settling  of  a  new  continent,  all  of  which  created  the  world  we  see  today  (see Succession and the  cycle of change). 
正是这种普遍的理想，导致了科学方法的发现、民主的重新发现和新大陆的建立，所有这些都创造了我们今天所看到的世界（见[演替和变化的循环]()）。
It's also the universal ideal that spurs the occasional renegade to discover something completely different like the general theory of relativity, string theory, or chaos theory. 
这也是一种普遍的理想，促使偶然的叛逆者发现一些完全不同的东西，比如广义相对论、弦论或混沌理论。

Conversely,  the  present methodical,  milestone-governed specialist approach is largely a mopping-up operation which leads to increasing levels of detail but no new ways of understanding things. 
相反，目前有条不紊、里程碑式的专家方法在很大程度上是一种扫荡行动，导致细节层次的增加，但没有对事物新的理解。
This way of thinking has dominated our culture  for  some  time,  where  problems  are  formulated  and  solved  within  the present framework of thinking, leading to the world and way of life described in The lock-in. 
这种思维方式主宰了我们的文化一段时间了，在目前的思维框架内制定和解决问题，导致了[锁住]()中描述的世界和生活方式。
If you want to change your life, don't be tempted to outsource your life  or  your  operations. 
如果你想改变你的生活，不要试图将你的生活外包出去。
You'll  never  know  which  kind  of  connections  or synergies you're missing and you'll only make yourself more dependent on your suppliers.
你永远不会知道你缺少的是哪种联系或协同效应，你只会让自己更加依赖你的供应商。
