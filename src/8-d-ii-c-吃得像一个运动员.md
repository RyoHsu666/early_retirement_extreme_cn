Recently, a diet of six meals a day has gained popularity. 
最近，一日六餐的饮食方式越来越流行。
This diet is inspired by  full-time  athletes,  especially  bodybuilders,  who,  in  contrast  to  full-time workers, do have the option of taking a snack break. 
这种节食法的灵感来自全职运动员，尤其是健美运动员，与全职工作者相比，他们确实可以选择吃零食休息。
Using blood sugar directly from the intestines and having them refueled every other hour by a meal is easier that  relying  on  blood  sugar  from  the liver,  which  gets  depleted (also known as "hitting  the  wall"  or  "tanking")  after  a  couple  hours  of  hard  work. 
直接从肠道获取血糖，每隔一小时通过进餐补充一次，这比依赖肝脏的血糖更容易。经过几个小时的艰苦工作，肝脏的血糖会消耗殆尽（也被称为“撞墙”或“罐装”）。
As  a consequence, the body will start producing insulin on a sustained basis. 
因此，身体将开始持续产生胰岛素。
Insulin is required to bring the sugar into the cells, where it is used. 
胰岛素需要将糖带入细胞，并在细胞中使用。
Of course, there's the problem  of  missing  a  meal. 
当然，还有缺餐的问题。
In  this  case,  insulin  levels  will  remain  high  in anticipation  of  sugar,  and  if  the  sugar  doesn't  arrive  on  schedule,  the  relatively elevated levels of insulin will drive blood sugar down and make the person very hungry. 
在这种情况下，胰岛素水平将保持在预期的高血糖水平，如果糖不能按时到达，相对较高的胰岛素水平将降低血糖，使人非常饥饿。
This is made worse if compounded by a workout, in which case hitting the  wall  comes  much  sooner  than  it  otherwise  would. 
如果再加上锻炼，情况会变得更糟，在这种情况下，撞墙的时间比不锻炼的时间要早得多。
It's  very  important  if  on this diet to eat constantly. 
如果采用这种饮食，不断进食是非常重要的。
It's a good thing too, because digesting food actually requires  a  substantial  amount  of  energy,  also  known  as  the  thermic  effect. 
这也是一件好事，因为消化食物实际上需要大量的能量，也就是热效应。
Generally less refined foods like vegetables and meats require up to one-third of their caloric value just to digest them. 
一般来说，蔬菜和肉类等不太精制的食物需要高达三分之一的热量才能消化。
Refined foods like white flour, sugars, and fat  require  almost  nothing. 
精制食品如白面粉、糖和脂肪几乎不需要任何东西。
This  is  great  news  for  the  athlete  but  bad  news  for regular folks, who don't work out 4-6 hours a day in pursuit of muscle mass. 
这对运动员来说是个好消息，但对普通人来说是个坏消息，他们每天不会锻炼4-6个小时来追求肌肉质量。
In this  case,  one  must  eat  very  small  meals  and  stay  clear  of  cookies  and  other highly  processed  foods. 
在这种情况下，一个人必须吃很少的食物，远离饼干和其他高度加工的食物。
In  my  opinion,  this  offers  few  benefits  for  a  normal person, who do just fine on liver glycogen without the need to "turbocharge" the blood sugar by continuous fueling. 
在我看来，这对正常人没有什么好处，他们在肝糖原方面做得很好，不需要通过持续加油来“提高”血糖。
Eating six meals a day also makes for a lot of hassle, such as keeping track of calories, planning meals, the problem of missing a meal and the resulting hunger pangs.
每天吃六顿饭也会带来很多麻烦，比如记录卡路里、计划膳食、错过一顿饭的问题以及由此产生的饥饿感。
