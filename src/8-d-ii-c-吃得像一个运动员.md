Recently, a diet of six meals a day has gained popularity. 

This diet is inspired by  full-time  athletes,  especially  bodybuilders,  who,  in  contrast  to  full-time workers, do have the option of taking a snack break. 

Using blood sugar directly from the intestines and having them refueled every other hour by a meal is easier that  relying  on  blood  sugar  from  the liver,  which  gets  depleted (also known as "hitting  the  wall"  or  "tanking")  after  a  couple  hours  of  hard  work. 

As  a consequence, the body will start producing insulin on a sustained basis. 

Insulin is required to bring the sugar into the cells, where it is used. 

Of course, there's the problem  of  missing  a  meal. 

In  this  case,  insulin  levels  will  remain  high  in anticipation  of  sugar,  and  if  the  sugar  doesn't  arrive  on  schedule,  the  relatively elevated levels of insulin will drive blood sugar down and make the person very hungry. 

This is made worse if compounded by a workout, in which case hitting the  wall  comes  much  sooner  than  it  otherwise  would. 

It's  very  important  if  on this diet to eat constantly. 

It's a good thing too, because digesting food actually requires  a  substantial  amount  of  energy,  also  known  as  the  thermic  effect. 

Generally less refined foods like vegetables and meats require up to one-third of their caloric value just to digest them. 

Refined foods like white flour, sugars, and fat  require  almost  nothing. 

This  is  great  news  for  the  athlete  but  bad  news  for regular folks, who don't work out 4-6 hours a day in pursuit of muscle mass. 

In this  case,  one  must  eat  very  small  meals  and  stay  clear  of  cookies  and  other highly  processed  foods. 

In  my  opinion,  this  offers  few  benefits  for  a  normal person, who do just fine on liver glycogen without the need to "turbocharge" the blood sugar by continuous fueling. 

Eating six meals a day also makes for a lot of hassle, such as keeping track of calories, planning meals, the problem of missing a meal and the resulting hunger pangs.
