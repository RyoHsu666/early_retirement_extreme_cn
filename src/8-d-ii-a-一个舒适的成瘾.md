Food is eaten for comfort when it's associated with good memories or even tradition,  like  the  morning  coffee,  the  Christmas  turkey,  or  soup  the  way  mom used  to  make  it--even  if  it's  now  made  in  a  factory. 
当食物与美好的记忆甚至传统联系在一起时，人们会为了舒适而吃，比如早上的咖啡、圣诞火鸡，或者妈妈以前做的汤——即使现在是在工厂里做的。
 This  kind  of  comfort  food doesn't  even  need  to  taste  particularly  good  to  people  outside  one's  particular culture, much like religious tenets often make little sense to people who follow a different faith. 
这种舒适的食物，对特定文化外的人，甚至不需要特别好吃，就像宗教信条，对不同的遵循信仰的人往往没有意义。

However,  food  can  also  be  directly  addictive. 
然而，食物也会直接上瘾。
 For  example,  the  amino  acid tryptophan, which is found in abundance in chocolate, oats, and milk and meat products,  is  a  precursor  for  the  neurotransmitter  serotonin,  which  improves mood. 
例如，在巧克力、燕麦、牛奶和肉制品中发现，大量的氨基酸，色氨酸是神经递质血清素的前体，血清素可以改善情绪。
Normally tryptophan competes with other complex amino acids for entry into the brain, but an increase in blood sugar, which can be accomplished with sugar, white flour, and other "fast" carbohydrates, decreases the blood level of all amino  acids  except  tryptophan,  leaving  it  without  competition  for  entry  at  the blood-brain  barrier. 
正常情况下，色氨酸与其他复杂氨基酸竞争进入大脑，但血糖的增加（可通过糖、白面粉和其他“快速”碳水化合物实现）会降低除色氨酸以外的所有氨基酸的血液水平，使其无法竞争进入血脑屏障。
 This  is  an  excellent  recipe  for  addiction. 
这是上瘾的绝妙方法。
 Chocolate  chip oatmeal cookies anyone? 
有人要巧克力片燕麦饼干吗？
 
 Here's  another  example. 
这是另一个例子。
 Milk  protein  is  primarily  composed  of  casein. 
牛奶蛋白质主要由酪蛋白组成。
Casein breaks down to casomorphin, which is an opioid, so named because of its similarity to opium. 
酪蛋白分解为卡索莫芬，卡索莫芬是一种阿片类物质，因其与鸦片相似而得名。
Casomorphin originates in the cow's liver, gets transferred to its  bloodstream,  and  ends  up  in  its  milk. 
卡索莫芬来源于牛的肝脏，转移到血液中，最后进入牛奶中。
 Casomorphin  is  particularly concentrated  in  cheese,  which  is  a  milk  product  from  which  water,  whey,  and lactose  have  been  removed. 
卡索莫芬特别集中在奶酪中，奶酪是一种乳制品，水、乳清和乳糖已从中去除。
 This  explains  why  cheese  is  very  addictive. 
这就解释了为什么奶酪很容易上瘾。
 It's perhaps  not  surprising  that  the  food  industry  spends  a  lot  of  money  hawking their products. 
食品行业花费大量资金推销他们的产品，这也许并不奇怪。
Something to keep in mind is that if a product needs advertising to  tell  you  it  is  good  for  you,  it  probably  isn't. 
要记住的是，如果一个产品需要广告来告诉你它对你有好处，那么它可能不是。
 I'll  leave  sugar  addiction  and various  other  food  addictions  as  a  research  project  for  the  reader  (see Physiological), but this does explain why changing one's diet can be very hard.
 我将把糖成瘾和其他各种食物成瘾，作为一个研究项目留给读者（参见[生理]()），但这确实解释了，为什么改变饮食非常困难。
