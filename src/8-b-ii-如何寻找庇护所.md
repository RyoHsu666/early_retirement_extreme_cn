The three most important things that matter for shelter are 

1.Location relative to your work.
2.Location relative to your grocery outlet.
3.Cost.

If  you  work  from  home,  it's  the  location  relative  to  your  customers  that matters.

If you don't need to go to your customers physically, this doesn't matter at  all.

If  you  can  grow  most  of  your  own  food,  location  relative  to  your  food supply  doesn't  matter  either.

You  may  want  to  consider  getting  food  shipped.

Run  the  calculation.

And  of  course,  if  you're  loaded,  you  don't  need  to  worry about cost--but then why are you reading this chapter? For now, let's assume that all three are important, as they would be for most people.


For renting, the method I use is to go to Craig's List and click on "housing.

" Then I put in my limits: $200 minimum (because that removes a lot of useless search  results)  and  $350  maximum.

If  you're  two  people  with  an  income,  you could put $400-$700.

It's likely that for certain areas, houses or apartments are simply  out  of  range.

In  this  case,  consider  cohousing,  roommates,  etc.

In particular,  consider  radical  alternatives.

We  currently  live  in  a  motorhome,  for example.

In addition, some of the cheaper places may not be heavily advertised.

We lived in the same place for two years before discovering an option that was $400/month  instead  of  $660/month.

Ask  around!  If  you're  priced  out  of  the market,  you  should  consider  other  areas.

I  wouldn't  be  too  tied  to  a  particular city.

Indeed, a frequent excuse is that, "I need to live here.

" Actually, unless you can document some critical need--for example, a medical reason for a particular climate--you only want to live in a particular place.

This want, then, comes down to paying extra versus your other goals.


The search should result in several potential addresses.

Next, find routes to work  and  groceries  respectively.

Get  a  map  and  some  tacks.

Mark  your  work address and the potential housing addresses and trace out connecting routes, then calculate the distances.


There are online tools that make this easy.

I  highly  recommend  not  owning  a  car  (but  see  Driving  for  a  possible exception!), since transportation will most likely be your second largest expense.

Therefore, check to see if those streets are walkable or bikeable--no disappearing sidewalks,  killer  intersections,  or  killer  people.

Online,  you  can  use  satellite views  of  the  map  at  maximum  resolution  to  scan  for  sidewalks.

Unfortunately, this requirement sometimes results in detours that can turn a three mile route into a four mile one.

Also get a map of bus stops or other public transportation.

Buses will  extend  your  range.

If  you  live  one  mile  from  a  bus  stop  and  your  work  is one mile from another bus stop, your effective distance is two miles.

Also check options for car pooling.


If you live in a region with heavy winters, you may want to walk rather than ride a bike.

72 In that case, limit your maximum distance to three miles (this will take about an hour to walk).

If you have a bike option, I would say seven miles, tops.

However,  perhaps  you're  tougher  than  I  am--some  bike  commuters  ride more than 15 miles each way, every day.

Walking a six mile round trip daily is certainly doable.

I did it daily for half a year once, but I wouldn't want to walk much farther than that; it simply takes too much time.


Some may  be  presently  bound  by  mortgages  that are  underwater (don't fall for  the  sunk  cost  fallacy)  or  by  not  having  sufficient  ready  funds  to  make  a deposit,  in  which  case  they  may  resort  to  just  reconsidering  or  postponing  the move.

Even if you're not going to move, try going through the exercise anyway just to realize that it's possible.

Don't worry, there are other ways to self-actualize and  gain  (self-)respect  than  living  in  expensive  housing.

Furthermore,  in  most vocations you'll rarely be keeping up appearances with anyone other than your neighbors.

73  Your  employer  and  clients  will  most  likely  not  even  know  where you live, and your real friends won't care (see People).
