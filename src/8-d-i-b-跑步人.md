Many  then  realize  the  importance  of  keeping  "in  shape,"  which  suggests  a specific  body  shape  with  a  lack  of  fat  in  the  wrong  places  like  thighs,  hips, stomach,  and  upper  arms,  and  muscle  in  the  right  places. 

For  some  strange reason  I  have  yet  to  uncover,  this  often  means  putting  on  running  shoes  and going for a jog.81 For the overweight, restricting calories will effectively reduce body size. 

Yet many runners and other people who do several hours of aerobic exercise each  week  often  suffer  from  "fat  aerobics  instructor  syndrome,"  with deposits  of  stubborn  fat  in  annoying  places  that  just  won't  go  away  and  even increase. 

The problem is that running or aerobic exercise in itself does very little for fat loss. 

Low-intensity exercise (see the list of intensity levels in this  table) doesn't burn many calories--a pound of fat, that is 4,200kcal, will supply enough energy for a 50mile run--and it doesn't burn any energy after the run. 

In fact, it may even be detrimental. 

Conversely, adding a pound of muscle mass increases the  daily  metabolic  rate  by  75-100kcal  just  to  keep  the  muscle  alive. 

It's  thus clear  that  decreasing  muscle  mass  is  self-defeating  as  a  strategy  to  fat  loss. 

Indeed,  looking  at  experienced  runners  with  their  relatively  spindly  arms  and legs with thighs no thicker than their necks, and soft and scrawny upper body, it's clear  that  the  adaptation  to  long  distance--anything  over  a  couple  of  miles-- running  doesn't  get  them  "in  shape."82  Furthermore,  no  activities  in  real  life require  jogging  or  rhythmically  jumping  around. 

Being  pursued  by  a  dog,  you sprint. 

If you're moving far under your own power, you either ride a bicycle  or you  walk. 

Most  activities  require  some  combination  of  agility,  strength,  and work capacity. 

Yet aerobics, running, or jogging enhance none of these qualities.
