Many  then  realize  the  importance  of  keeping  "in  shape,"  which  suggests  a specific  body  shape  with  a  lack  of  fat  in  the  wrong  places  like  thighs,  hips, stomach,  and  upper  arms,  and  muscle  in  the  right  places. 
许多人随后意识到保持“身材”的重要性，这意味着一个特定的体形，在错误的地方减少脂肪，比如大腿、臀部、肚子和上臂，这些是肌肉正确的地方。
For  some  strange reason  I  have  yet  to  uncover,  this  often  means  putting  on  running  shoes  and going for a jog.81 
出于一些我尚未发现的奇怪原因，这通常意味着穿上跑鞋和慢跑。
For the overweight, restricting calories will effectively reduce body size. 
对于超重的人来说，限制卡路里摄入将有效地缩小体型。
Yet many runners and other people who do several hours of aerobic exercise each  week  often  suffer  from  "fat  aerobics  instructor  syndrome,"  with deposits  of  stubborn  fat  in  annoying  places  that  just  won't  go  away  and  even increase. 
然而，许多跑步者和其他每周做几个小时有氧运动的人经常患有“肥胖有氧运动教练综合症”，顽固的脂肪沉积在恼人的地方，不会消失甚至增加。
The problem is that running or aerobic exercise in itself does very little for fat loss. 
问题是，跑步或有氧运动本身对脂肪损坏的作用很小。
Low-intensity exercise (see the list of intensity levels in this  table) doesn't burn many calories--a pound of fat, that is 4,200kcal, will supply enough energy for a 50mile run--and it doesn't burn any energy after the run. 
低强度运动（参见本表中的[强度等级列表]()）不会燃烧很多卡路里——0.5公斤脂肪，即4200卡路里，可以为80公里的跑步提供足够的能量——而且跑步后也不会燃烧任何能量。
In fact, it may even be detrimental. 
事实上，这甚至可能是有害的。
Conversely, adding a pound of muscle mass increases the  daily  metabolic  rate  by  75-100kcal  just  to  keep  the  muscle  alive. 
相反，增加0.5公斤的肌肉重量可以增加每日75-100千卡的代谢率，以保持肌肉的活力。
It's  thus clear  that  decreasing  muscle  mass  is  self-defeating  as  a  strategy  to  fat  loss. 
因此，很明显，减少肌肉质量是一种自我挫败的减肥策略。
Indeed,  looking  at  experienced  runners  with  their  relatively  spindly  arms  and legs with thighs no thicker than their necks, and soft and scrawny upper body, it's clear  that  the  adaptation  to  long  distance--anything  over  a  couple  of  miles-- running  doesn't  get  them  "in  shape."82  Furthermore,  no  activities  in  real  life require  jogging  or  rhythmically  jumping  around. 
事实上，看看经验丰富的跑步者，他们的手臂和腿相对细长，大腿不比脖子粗，上身柔软瘦削，很明显，适应长距离——任何超过几公里的运动——并不能让他们“保持身材”。此外，现实生活中没有任何活动需要慢跑或有节奏地跳跃。
Being  pursued  by  a  dog,  you sprint. 
被狗追赶时，你会冲刺。
If you're moving far under your own power, you either ride a bicycle  or you  walk. 
如果你靠自己的力量走得很远，你要么骑自行车，要么走路。
Most  activities  require  some  combination  of  agility,  strength,  and work capacity. 
大多数活动都需要灵活性、力量和工作能力的结合。
Yet aerobics, running, or jogging enhance none of these qualities.
然而，有氧运动、跑步或慢跑都不能提高这些素质。
