Doing  anything  usually  requires  a  tool  and  someone  using  that  tool. 

做任何事情通常需要工具和用这个工具的人。

 An
experienced tool user will think of the tool as an extension of himself. 

一个熟练的使用者会认为工具是自己的延申。

Hence, it's
hard to tell where the tool ends and the tool user begins; after all, what is a tool
really, if nobody's using it? This line of thinking extends to all the things we
surround ourselves with. 

然而，很难界定哪里是工具的末端，哪里是使用者的开始；毕竟，如果一个工具没人使用，那工具究竟是什么？这条思考可以扩展到围绕我们的所有事物。

If no one is living in it, a house is not a home but is
rather a useless arrangement of sticks and bricks (see Building blocks). 

如果没人居住，那房子不过是一堆没用的钢筋水泥（参见[建造模块]()）。

It's said
that a person with skills can do more with less, yet nobody is so skilled to be
able to do everything with nothing, and many tools have indeed allowed people
to do things better than they otherwise would. 

众所周知一个有技术的人可以不用很多东西就做很多事，然而没人技术高到可以什么都不借助就做所有事，很多工具也确实让人们把事情做的更好。

On the other hand, many have
become unskilled by the easy availability of technological replacements, and so
they sometimes end up doing things worse, as well as ending up with a large
amount  of  stuff. 

另一方面，容易获取到的技术替代品让很多人变得技术缺乏，因此他们有些时候买了一大堆东西，最后事情还做的很糟。

 There  should  therefore  be  a  continuous  drive  toward
internalizing skills. After all, you can always lose your tools, but skills stay with
you.

个人技能的提升需要持续的驱动。毕竟，你终归会失去你的工具，但是技能会始终陪伴着你。

From a skill-based-Renaissance perspective, possessions are problematic in
the following ways and acquisition should therefore be considered carefully:

从一个基于技能的文艺复兴式的视角看，财物有如下问题，购入它们时需要仔细斟酌：

They cost money.

它们费钱。

They take up space.

它们占据空间。

They require maintenance.

它们需要维护。

They often act as a gateway to additional or more expensive things.

它们经常扮演额外或更贵东西的桥梁。

They can be taken away from you.

它们能被从你身边带走。

They are hard to get rid of.

它们很难摆脱。

The first problem is that they cost money, which is a negative limiting factor
(see  Effect-mapping). 

第一问题是费钱，这是最大的负面限制因素（参见[影响图]()）。

 However,  these  days  many  consumer  goods  are  very
cheap from a historical perspective, so this is the least of the problems.

然而，如今很多消费品从历史的角度上看非常便宜，所以这至少是一个问题。

 With few
exceptions, you can have any one thing you want, but few can have it all, not
that most don't try. 

除了极少数例外，你能拥有任何你想要的东西，很少人能全部拥有，甚至尝试的机会都没有。

It's very hard for a person in an affluent society not to end up
with a lot of stuff, and a lot of effort has to be put into avoiding this.

在一个富裕的社会里，一个人最后不积攒一大堆东西很难，需要投入很大精力来避免这样。

 Possessions
take  up  space  and  the  indirect  costs  of  storage55  can  be  substantial. 

财务占据空间，在存储上的花费是很明显的。

 It's
sometimes jokingly said that a house is merely a roof to cover our possessions.

有些时候机会可以开玩笑地说，房子就是在我们的财务上面加了个盖。

Notice how possessions tend to increase and expand to cover all possible closet
and storage space. 

你会注意到财务是如何趋向于增加和扩张到所有可能的储藏空间。

Sooner or later the house will feel cramped with clutter. 

早晚房子会因为狭窄而感到束缚。

This
happens when storage becomes inefficient (see Sigmoids, logistic curves, and
the  maximum  power  principle)  and  more  and  more  effort  has  to  be  put  into
playing Tetris with your stuff and fitting just one more item into an already full
closet.56  

当存储变的无效的时候（参见[S型曲线逻辑曲线和最大能量原则.md]()）这就会发生，越来越多的努力用来玩俄罗斯方块，再把一件东西放进已经满了的匣子里。

At  this  point  consumers  start  talking  about  the  "need"  for  more
bedrooms. 

这时候消费者开始谈论再多一个卧室的“需求”。

 These  bedrooms  are  costly. 

这些卧室也是造价不菲的。 

  Not  only  are  bigger  houses  more
expensive, they also come with higher property taxes. 

不只是大房子更贵，也因为它们有更高的税。

It's traditional to heat the
entire house to 20C (68F).

传统上，整个房子要供热到20℃（68℉）。

 In other words, money is paid and gas is burned to
make  one's  possessions  as  comfortable  temperature-wise  as  the  inhabitants.

换句话说，为个人财物作为居住者提供舒适的温度，也花了取暖费。

Interestingly, storage costs are related to the volume and not the price of what
you're  storing--transportation  (and  often  environmental)  costs  are  typically
related  to  weight. 

有趣的是，存储的成本和体积正相关，和存储物的价格没关——运输的成本通常和重量相关。

 As  a  consequence,  I  consider  not  only  the  price,  but  also
volume and mass when I buy something.

作为延续，我考虑的不只是价格，还有我买的东西的重量和体积。

 The costs manifest mainly as real estate
costs--that is, paying to put your stuff somewhere--and if you put it in your main
residence and subscribe to central heating, the cost of keeping it at a comfortable
temperature.

费用清单主要是固定资产花费，也就是，把你的东西放在什么地方的花费，如你把它放在主卧室并提供中央空调，让它保持在舒适温度的花费。

 Stuff is also hard to transport, so having a large amount of stuff
makes it difficult to move and therefore it acts as an anchor on your mobility.

东西也很难移动，所以一大堆堆东西非常难移动，它也就变成了限制你机动性的锚。

Maintenance  includes  everything  from  simple  repair--if  you  can't  do  it
yourself--to  fuel  costs  and  insurance. 

维护包括所有东西的简单维修，包括油费和保险这些你不能自己做的。

 Lifestyle  inflation  is  a  well-known  and
well-exploited phenomenon. 

生活方式平坦化是众所周知和被过度开发的现象。

Just think about accessories and the next upgrade.

想想那些附属物和下次的升级。

Things can be taken away from you. They can be lost in a fire, stolen, or simply
confiscated.

东西被从你身边带走。它们可以是消失在火里，被偷了或者简单地被没收。

 I don't own anything tangible that would be heartbreaking to lose or
which  has  substantial  replacement  costs. 

我不持有那些丢失会让人心碎的，或者有高昂替换成本的有形物品。

 The  sum  total  of  my  possessions,
including my residence, would cost less than 10% of my net worth. 

所有我的财物，包括我的居所，加起来少于我净值的10%。

The final
problem is a curious aspect of living in a society of material abundance: Things
are much harder to get rid of than they are to acquire in the first place. 

最后的问题就是当今社会材料丢弃的一个奇怪现象：和最初购入相比，物品非常难以摆脱。

It's very
easy for Aunt Martha to acquire the proverbial ugly vase, but it would be very
hard for you to get rid of it, other than throwing it in the trash, and throwing
useful things in the trash is simply irresponsible.

向你姑妈Martha要一个众所周知的丑陋花瓶非常容易，但是你想摆脱它却非常难，比如把它扔到垃圾堆里，因为把有用的东西扔到垃圾堆里是不对的。

A few notes on simple living

一个简单生活的小笔记

Simple living isn't  about  decluttering  and  reducing  the  amount  of  stuff  in
your  life  or  putting  everything  on  autopilot. 

简单生活不是减少生活物品的数量或者让所有东西都处于自动驾驶状态。

 Popular  approaches  attempt  to
achieve some arrangement of meaningful things that are left after eliminating
superfluous stuff or engagements.

流行的方法是尝试让有意义的东西，那些消除了多余和经常使用的东西，妥善安置，

 This can even turn into a substitute faith or a
counterreaction of anti-materialism.

这甚至可以作为对抗物质主要的主要信条。

In our approach we are in fact aiming to build as much internal complexity
into  the  strategy  as  possible. 

在我们的方法中，我们的目标是尽可能建立内部的复杂化。

 This  should  be  clear  from  Strategy,  tactics,  and
guiding principles.


这应该和策略，战术和指导原则区分开。

===


All this means that the total cost of stuff is much larger than its initial sticker
price. 

所有这些都意味着你物品的总价值要大于它们初始的价格标签。

Despite this, and perhaps due to short-sightedness or failure to take the
systemic problem into account, owning many things is often confused with a
high  quality  of  life.57 

令人失望的是，可能是由于短视或者系统性的错误，拥有很多东西经常被迷惑性地当作高质量生活。

 Hence,  reducing  the  amount  of  stuff  is  perceived  as  a
major barrier. 

然而，减少物品的数量成了主要的障碍。

As a counterreaction, a recent trend towards simplification is to
own as few things as possible. 

作为反击，最近的流行趋势是越少持有东西越好。

Here, the barrier prevents owning more things.

这里，障碍是阻止拥有更多东西。

The optimal point is somewhere in the middle. 

最优的点是在中间的某个位置。

In particular, it's important to
realize that it's not the things themselves that are the problem; it is their side
effects! So with this in mind...


特别重要的，要知道不是事物本身是问题，而是它们的侧面影响！
