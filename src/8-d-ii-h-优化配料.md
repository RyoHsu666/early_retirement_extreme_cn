There  are  plenty  of  different  diets  out  there. 
有很多不同的饮食。
By  diet  I  simply  mean  a particular way of eating; not necessarily with the goal of losing weight or even maintaining  any kind of  consistency. 
我所说的饮食只是指一种特殊的吃饭方式；不是为了减肥，也不是为了保持一致性。
Diet seems  to be a personal  choice  based on  physiology  and  habit. 
饮食似乎是基于生理和习惯的个人选择。
I'm  not  going  to  recommend  anything  in  particular, other than not eating too much or building towards downstream health problems from a junk diet. 
我不会特别推荐任何东西，除了不要吃得太多或者避免垃圾饮食带来的健康问题。
Given a diet, ingredients can be chosen in the following ways: 
给定饮食，可通过以下方式选择配料：
Spontaneous (no recipe) 
Shopping list (recipes before ingredients) 
Staples and opportunism (ingredients before recipes) 


"Spontaneous"  food  shopping  happens  without  any  particular  strategy. 

The mission  is  to  get  something  to  eat. 

Often  this  leads  to  ready-to-eat  meals  or ordering a pizza. 

This is an inefficient way to spend resources, and because it's inefficient, it's expensive. 


Shopping with  a list  is  perhaps  the  most  popular  way  of  shopping. 

A  meal plan is selected and a shopping list is created, based upon which ingredients are needed. 

Economically, this is better than spontaneous shopping because it tends to avoid the TV dinners, but it's still not optimal because it doesn't take sales into account. 

Missing ingredients are bought regardless of their cost. 


The most optimal method is to shop for ingredients, and then, based on the ingredients one has available, determine a recipe. 

This allows one to buy food on sale,  typically  loss-leaders. 

The  supermarket's  sales  strategy  thus  drives  what's for dinner. 

To make this work, it's necessary to have some staples on  hand (say pasta  and  beans)  which  the  loss-leaders  (say  tomatoes,  zucchini,  and  minced meat) can be combined with. 

If you pay attention, you'll notice that loss-leaders are  typically  on  rotation;  something  on  sale  now  will  be  on  sale  again  in  the future. 

Wait for it and eat whatever else is on sale in the meantime. 


Creating a pantry of staples works on exactly the same principles as creating a  wardrobe  (see  How  to  build  a  wardrobe). 

Here  the  ingredients  are  to  the recipes  what  clothes  in  the  wardrobe  are  to  outfits. 

Of  course,  it's  possible  to write  out  the  solution,  but  it's  likely  to  require  more  paper  than  the  wardrobe. 

Another way is to use websites like supercook.com to do it. 

The traditional best way  is  to  learn  several  recipes  and  notice  which  ingredients  they  have  in common. 

If  one  recipe  includes  an  ingredient  that  is  used  in  only  that  recipe, avoid the recipe. 

The more it's optimized, the easier it is to manage the system, but obviously there are diminishing returns to obsessing over which recipes have the most synergy. 


Another  way  to  sort  through  your  existing  ingredients  (a  method  that  also work for utensils, incidentally) is to set aside a table in your kitchen for a month and put any ingredient on the table once you're done using it rather than putting it  back. 

After  a  month,  anything  still  left  in  the  cupboards  are  ingredients  you practically never use (see How to get rid of things). 


As  mentioned  above  (see  A  comfortable  addiction),  if  a  brand  needs advertising,  it  is  probably  because  it  is  either  difficult  to  tell  the  difference between it and another brand or because you would not otherwise want to buy the product in the first place. 

None of the ingredients I use seem to come with coupons, and so I don't clip coupons. 

I do admit that coupons offer spectacular savings,  but  these  savings  are  almost  exclusively  concentrated  in  preprocessed foods. 

For  our  purposes,  we  only  really  need  to  shop  in  the  grain,  meat,  and produce  sections. 

Not  clipping  coupons  saves  time  organizing  them  as  well  as running around to different shops to use them. 


A  search  will  generally  reveal  one,  or  at  most  two  stores  nearby  (see Transportation)  that  can  supply  all  your  needs. 

A  systematic  search  may  be  in order: Travel all the streets of your city and visit all the stores, making a note of their  prices and selection. 

Relying on  junkmail  or  chain  stores  usually  isn't  the best solution. 

Put in some footwork! It's good exercise. 


Set a strict food budget item: You'll notice that your total caloric intake will fall. 

You'll eat less processed food; likely none at all. 

As a result, your general health will improve and your long-term health expenses will decline, maybe to a point where you don't need to stay employed to be able to afford your required medical care. 


Budget $80/person/month for food and only shop once a week, keeping track of  food  costs  with  a  notebook  or  by  paying  in  cash. 

As  novices  (see  Gauging mastery) may find it challenging to spread the budget equitably over the entire month,  dividing  it  into  a  weekly  budget  may  be  helpful.Building  up  a  store  of food, thus decoupling shopping  from cooking, allows one to  wait  for sales  and thus to spend money almost exclusively on sales. 

This only works with storable food  groups. 

Here,  a  freezer  is  much  better  than  a  refrigerator,  and  if  I  could choose  only  one,  I'd  choose  to  have  a  freezer  over  a  refrigerator,  but  I'd  rather have  neither. 

This  may  be  surprising,  especially  considering  that  we  tend  to believe  that  everything  needs  to  be  refrigerated. 

However,  see  the  next  section for suggestions of what can be stored without the noise and electricity usage of a refrigerator  or  freezer. 

Storing  also  avoids  having  to  engage  in  the  proverbial scramble for milk, eggs, and bread whenever the weather forecast is unfavorable.
