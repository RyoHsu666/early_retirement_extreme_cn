There  are  plenty  of  different  diets  out  there. 
有很多不同的饮食。
By  diet  I  simply  mean  a particular way of eating; not necessarily with the goal of losing weight or even maintaining  any kind of  consistency. 
我所说的饮食只是指一种特殊的吃饭方式；不是为了减肥，也不是为了保持一致性。
Diet seems  to be a personal  choice  based on  physiology  and  habit. 
饮食似乎是基于生理和习惯的个人选择。
I'm  not  going  to  recommend  anything  in  particular, other than not eating too much or building towards downstream health problems from a junk diet. 
我不会特别推荐任何东西，除了不要吃得太多或者避免垃圾饮食带来的健康问题。
Given a diet, ingredients can be chosen in the following ways: 
给定饮食，可通过以下方式选择配料：
Spontaneous (no recipe) 
Shopping list (recipes before ingredients) 
Staples and opportunism (ingredients before recipes) 
- 自发的（没食谱）
- 购物清单（依照食谱买配料）
- 主料和机会主义（买的配料就是食谱）

"Spontaneous"  food  shopping  happens  without  any  particular  strategy. 
“自发”的食品购物没有任何特定的策略。
The mission  is  to  get  something  to  eat. 
任务是整点吃的。
Often  this  leads  to  ready-to-eat  meals  or ordering a pizza. 
这通常会导致快餐或订购比萨。
This is an inefficient way to spend resources, and because it's inefficient, it's expensive. 
这是一种浪费资源的低效方式，而且因为低效，所以成本高昂。

Shopping with  a list  is  perhaps  the  most  popular  way  of  shopping. 
列出购物清单可能是最流行的购物方式。
A  meal plan is selected and a shopping list is created, based upon which ingredients are needed. 
选择一份膳食计划，并根据所需的配料创建一份购物清单。
Economically, this is better than spontaneous shopping because it tends to avoid the TV dinners, but it's still not optimal because it doesn't take sales into account. 
从经济上讲，这比自发购物要好，因为它倾向于避免电视晚餐，但它仍然不是最优的，因为它没有考虑销售。
Missing ingredients are bought regardless of their cost. 
缺失的原料不管多贵都会被购买。

The most optimal method is to shop for ingredients, and then, based on the ingredients one has available, determine a recipe. 
最理想的方法是购买配料，然后根据可用的配料确定配方。
This allows one to buy food on sale,  typically  loss-leaders. 
这使得人们可以购买特价食品，通常是亏损领导者。
The  supermarket's  sales  strategy  thus  drives  what's for dinner. 
因此，超市的销售策略决定了晚餐的种类。
To make this work, it's necessary to have some staples on  hand (say pasta  and  beans)  which  the  loss-leaders  (say  tomatoes,  zucchini,  and  minced meat) can be combined with. 
为了实现这一点，有必要屯一些主食（比如意大利面和豆类），和亏损领导者（比如西红柿、西葫芦和肉末）与之搭配。
If you pay attention, you'll notice that loss-leaders are  typically  on  rotation;  something  on  sale  now  will  be  on  sale  again  in  the future. 
如果你注意的话，你会注意到亏损领导者通常是轮换的；现在正在打折的东西将来还会再打折。
Wait for it and eat whatever else is on sale in the meantime. 
等着吃，同时吃其他打折的东西。

Creating a pantry of staples works on exactly the same principles as creating a  wardrobe  (see  How  to  build  a  wardrobe). 
创建主食储藏室的原理与创建衣柜的原理完全相同（请参见[如何构建衣柜]()）。
Here  the  ingredients  are  to  the recipes  what  clothes  in  the  wardrobe  are  to  outfits. 
这里的配料与食谱的关系，就像衣柜里的衣服与衣服的关系一样。
Of  course,  it's  possible  to write  out  the  solution,  but  it's  likely  to  require  more  paper  than  the  wardrobe. 
当然，可以写出解决方案，但这可能需要比衣柜更多的纸张。
Another way is to use websites like supercook.com to do it. 
另一种方法是使用像supercook.com来做这件事。
The traditional best way  is  to  learn  several  recipes  and  notice  which  ingredients  they  have  in common. 
传统上最好的方法是学习几种食谱，并注意它们的共同成分。
If  one  recipe  includes  an  ingredient  that  is  used  in  only  that  recipe, avoid the recipe. 
如果一个配方包含仅在该配方中使用的成分，请避免使用该配方。
The more it's optimized, the easier it is to manage the system, but obviously there are diminishing returns to obsessing over which recipes have the most synergy. 
优化得越多，管理系统就越容易，但显然，痴迷于哪种配方最具协同效应的回报会越来越少。

Another  way  to  sort  through  your  existing  ingredients  (a  method  that  also work for utensils, incidentally) is to set aside a table in your kitchen for a month and put any ingredient on the table once you're done using it rather than putting it  back. 
另一种对现有配料进行分类的方法（顺便说一句，这种方法也适用于餐具）是在厨房里放一张桌子一个月，用完后把任何配料放在桌子上，而不是放回去。
After  a  month,  anything  still  left  in  the  cupboards  are  ingredients  you practically never use (see How to get rid of things). 
一个月后，橱柜里剩下的任何东西都是你几乎从未使用过的配料（看看[如何处理掉这些东西]()）。

As  mentioned  above  (see  A  comfortable  addiction),  if  a  brand  needs advertising,  it  is  probably  because  it  is  either  difficult  to  tell  the  difference between it and another brand or because you would not otherwise want to buy the product in the first place. 
如上所述（参见[舒适的上瘾]()），如果一个品牌需要广告，可能是因为很难区分它与另一个品牌的区别，或者是因为你本来就不想购买该产品。
None of the ingredients I use seem to come with coupons, and so I don't clip coupons. 
我使用的所有原料似乎都没有优惠券，所以我不剪优惠券。
I do admit that coupons offer spectacular savings,  but  these  savings  are  almost  exclusively  concentrated  in  preprocessed foods. 
我承认优惠券能带来可观的节约，但这些节约几乎完全集中在预处理食品上。
For  our  purposes,  we  only  really  need  to  shop  in  the  grain,  meat,  and produce  sections. 
就我们的目的而言，我们只需要在谷物、肉类和农产品区购物。
Not  clipping  coupons  saves  time  organizing  them  as  well  as running around to different shops to use them. 
不剪优惠券既节省了整理优惠券的时间，也节省了奔波到不同商店使用优惠券的时间。

A  search  will  generally  reveal  one,  or  at  most  two  stores  nearby  (see Transportation)  that  can  supply  all  your  needs. 
搜索通常会发现附近有一家或最多两家商店（见[交通]()）可以满足你的所有需求。
A  systematic  search  may  be  in order: Travel all the streets of your city and visit all the stores, making a note of their  prices and selection. 
一个系统的搜索可能是：走遍你所在城市的所有街道，参观所有的商店，记下它们的价格和选择。
Relying on  junkmail  or  chain  stores  usually  isn't  the best solution. 
依靠垃圾邮件或连锁店通常不是最好的解决方案。
Put in some footwork! It's good exercise. 
做些走路的工作！这是很好的锻炼。

Set a strict food budget item: You'll notice that your total caloric intake will fall. 
设定一个严格的食物预算项目：你会注意到你的总热量摄入会下降。
You'll eat less processed food; likely none at all. 
你会少吃加工食品；可能一点都不吃了。
As a result, your general health will improve and your long-term health expenses will decline, maybe to a point where you don't need to stay employed to be able to afford your required medical care. 
结果，你的总体健康状况会有所改善，长期健康费用也会下降，也许到了某个程度，你就不需要继续工作来支付所需的医疗费用了。

Budget $80/person/month for food and only shop once a week, keeping track of  food  costs  with  a  notebook  or  by  paying  in  cash. 
预算80美元/人/月用于食品，每周只购物一次，用笔记本或现金记录食品成本。
As  novices  (see  Gauging mastery) may find it challenging to spread the budget equitably over the entire month,  dividing  it  into  a  weekly  budget  may  be  helpful.Building  up  a  store  of food, thus decoupling shopping  from cooking, allows one to  wait  for sales  and thus to spend money almost exclusively on sales. 
由于新手（参见[衡量精通]()）可能会发现在整个月内公平分配预算很有挑战性，因此将其划分为每周预算可能会有所帮助。建立一个食品商店，从而使购物与烹饪脱钩，让人可以等待销售，而不是将钱完全花在销售上。
This only works with storable food  groups. 
这只适用于可储存食物组。
Here,  a  freezer  is  much  better  than  a  refrigerator,  and  if  I  could choose  only  one,  I'd  choose  to  have  a  freezer  over  a  refrigerator,  but  I'd  rather have  neither. 
在这里，冰柜比冰箱好得多，如果我只能选择一个，我会选择一个冰柜而不是冰箱，但我宁愿两者都没有。
This  may  be  surprising,  especially  considering  that  we  tend  to believe  that  everything  needs  to  be  refrigerated. 
这可能令人惊讶，特别是考虑到我们倾向于相信所有东西都需要冷藏。
However,  see  the  next  section for suggestions of what can be stored without the noise and electricity usage of a refrigerator  or  freezer. 
但是，请参阅下一节，了解在没有冰箱或冰柜噪音和用电的情况下可以储存什么的建议。
Storing  also  avoids  having  to  engage  in  the  proverbial scramble for milk, eggs, and bread whenever the weather forecast is unfavorable.
储存也避免了在天气预报不好的时候不得不去争抢牛奶、鸡蛋和面包。
