Wardrobes often show a history of fashion, sales, sudden inspirations (good and bad), and changing weight.

It's apparently not unusual to budget for clothes as  a  recurrent  expense  just  to  keep  up  with  fashion  and  maintain  a  sufficient selection  of  outfits.

As  a  result,  clothes  are  bought  cheap  (sometimes  extra  is paid  for  branding)  and  considered  disposable.

However,  clothes  should  be considered  durable  goods  (see  Depreciation  schedules)  and  tools  to  serve  a purpose.

This  means  that  an  item  must  be  carefully  considered  (if  in  doubt, always  postpone).

It  must  look  good,  fit  the  body,  fit  the  temperature,  not  be sticky nor restrictive.

If it doesn't allow a comfortable five mile walk or standing around outside and inside for one hour while wearing it, it fails.

The  process  of  dressing  for  form  and  function  is  well-known:  layers.

The outer layer determines the form and contributes to the function.

The rest of the layers  are  pure  function.

Layers  allow  for  flexibility  in  activity  level  and inclement weather and they trap more air in cold climates--anyone feeling cold and  wearing  anything  less  than  three  layers,  if  not  four,  isn't  trying  hard enough.

75  The  inner  layer  should  be  sweat-transporting  (quick  drying).

This typically means technical fibers like polypropylene or similar.

If you don't plan on sweating much or if evaporative  cooling is actually desired, cotton is good.

The midlayer should be sweat-absorbing and warming.

The best material for this is wool; down if it is really cold and you can keep it dry; wool works fine wet.

If you  can't  afford  wool,  you  can  also  use  fleece.

Cotton  will  also  do  in  a  pinch.

The outer layer should be water-and wind-proof.

This combination provides the most  comfortable  combination.

Waxed  cotton  is  probably  the  most  durable  if you plan to keep your jacket for more than a decade, since it's easier to refurbish than  using  water-repellent  chemicals  on  your  technical  jackets.

Also  consider that  zippers  do  wear  out  and  they  are  harder  to  replace  than  buttons,  which anyone  can  replace.

In  sunny  conditions,  the  clothes  should  be  UV  resistant (darker and tightly woven); in warm conditions, the clothes should be loose and allow  air  to  pass  and  cool--don't  ruin  heat  adaptation  by  switching  on  air conditioning;  in  cold  conditions,  the  clothes  should  be  tight,  particularly  at  the sleeves and collar, much like the business suit mentioned earlier.

Also consider that the radiative heating component is strong for dark colors and weak for light colors.

Hence, darker winter jackets provide more heat but also greater volatility.

Instead of a growing collection of clothing, much of which is obsolete or not generally  useful,  what  is  needed  is  a  strategy  to  increase  the  number  of  outfits while minimizing the number of individual items.
