Wardrobes often show a history of fashion, sales, sudden inspirations (good and bad), and changing weight.
衣橱通常展示了时尚、销售、突发灵感（好与坏）和体重变化的历史。
It's apparently not unusual to budget for clothes as  a  recurrent  expense  just  to  keep  up  with  fashion  and  maintain  a  sufficient selection  of  outfits.
显然，仅仅为了跟上时尚潮流和保持足够的衣服选择，将衣服预算作为经常性开支并不罕见。
As  a  result,  clothes  are  bought  cheap  (sometimes  extra  is paid  for  branding)  and  considered  disposable.
因此，人们买衣服时很便宜（有时打品牌需要额外付费），而且被认为是一次性的。
However,  clothes  should  be considered  durable  goods  (see  Depreciation  schedules)  and  tools  to  serve  a purpose.
然而，衣服应该被视为耐用品（见[折旧时间表]()）和用于某种用途的工具。
This  means  that  an  item  must  be  carefully  considered  (if  in  doubt, always  postpone).
这意味着必须仔细考虑某个项目（如果有疑问，请始终推迟）。
It  must  look  good,  fit  the  body,  fit  the  temperature,  not  be sticky nor restrictive.
它必须看起来很好，适合身体，适合温度，不粘也不受限制。
If it doesn't allow a comfortable five mile walk or standing around outside and inside for one hour while wearing it, it fails.
如果戴着它不能舒适地走八公里，或在室内外站上一个小时，它就是失败的。

The  process  of  dressing  for  form  and  function  is  well-known:  layers.
人们都知道穿衣的过程：层次。
The outer layer determines the form and contributes to the function.
外层决定了形式，并有助于发挥功能。
The rest of the layers  are  pure  function.
其余的层都是纯功能层。
Layers  allow  for  flexibility  in  activity  level  and inclement weather and they trap more air in cold climates--anyone feeling cold and  wearing  anything  less  than  three  layers,  if  not  four,  isn't  trying  hard enough.75  
在活动水平和恶劣天气条件下，分层可以提供灵活性，在寒冷气候下，它们可以困住更多的空气——任何感觉寒冷、穿着少于三层（如果不是四层）的衣服的人都没有穿足够的衣服。
The  inner  layer  should  be  sweat-transporting  (quick  drying).
内层应为汗液输送（快干）。
This typically means technical fibers like polypropylene or similar.
这通常意味着聚丙烯或类似的技术纤维。
If you don't plan on sweating much or if evaporative  cooling is actually desired, cotton is good.
如果你不打算大汗淋漓，或者确实需要蒸发冷却，那么棉质面料就很好。
The midlayer should be sweat-absorbing and warming.
中间层应该能吸汗并保暖。
The best material for this is wool; down if it is really cold and you can keep it dry; wool works fine wet.
最好的材料是羊毛;如果真的很冷，你可以保持干燥;羊毛在潮湿时效果也行。
If you  can't  afford  wool,  you  can  also  use  fleece.
如果你买不起羊毛，你还也可以使用抓绒。
Cotton  will  also  do  in  a  pinch.
棉花在也可以。
The outer layer should be water-and wind-proof.
外层应防风防水。
This combination provides the most  comfortable  combination.
这提供了最舒适的组合。
Waxed  cotton  is  probably  the  most  durable  if you plan to keep your jacket for more than a decade, since it's easier to refurbish than  using  water-repellent  chemicals  on  your  technical  jackets.
如果你打算将夹克穿十年以上，打蜡棉可能是最耐用的，因为它比在技术夹克上使用防水化学品更容易翻新。
Also  consider that  zippers  do  wear  out  and  they  are  harder  to  replace  than  buttons,  which anyone  can  replace.
还要考虑拉链会磨损，而且比纽扣更难更换，纽扣谁都会换。
In  sunny  conditions,  the  clothes  should  be  UV  resistant (darker and tightly woven); in warm conditions, the clothes should be loose and allow  air  to  pass  and  cool--don't  ruin  heat  adaptation  by  switching  on  air conditioning;  in  cold  conditions,  the  clothes  should  be  tight,  particularly  at  the sleeves and collar, much like the business suit mentioned earlier.
在阳光充足的条件下，衣服应防紫外线（颜色较深，编织紧密）；在温暖的环境下，衣服应该宽松，让空气流通和冷却——不要通过打开空调破坏热适应；在寒冷条件下，衣服应该很紧，尤其是袖子和领子，就像前面提到的商务套装一样。
Also consider that the radiative heating component is strong for dark colors and weak for light colors.
还考虑到辐射加热效应，深色强和浅色弱。
Hence, darker winter jackets provide more heat but also greater volatility.
因此，深色的冬季夹克可以提供更多热量，但也会带来更大的波动性。

Instead of a growing collection of clothing, much of which is obsolete or not generally  useful,  what  is  needed  is  a  strategy  to  increase  the  number  of  outfits while minimizing the number of individual items.
我们需要的不是越来越多的衣服，这些衣服其中很多已经过时或没有普遍用途，需要的是一种策略，在增加装束数量的同时尽量减少单独物品的数量。
