In the real world, it is unlikely that i will stay constant.

在现实世界中，i不太可能会保持稳定。

 The principal P may
also  vary  substantially  if  it  is  invested  in  the  market.  

原则上，如果是市场投资的话，P也会变化。

Furthermore,  there  is
inflation to contend with. 

另外，还要考虑通货膨胀。

The equations derived in Financial independence and
investing therefore either have to be expanded or used with a significant margin
of safety. 

在财务[独立和投资]()里的公式需要扩展或者使用一个显著的安全边界。

It's very tempting to plug in return rates of 10% or even higher and
derive very favorable terms--for example, a mere 15% savings rate and a return
rate  of  10%  allows  one  to  retire  "early"  after  about  20  years  of  work.  

将投资回报率提升至10%或者更高，以产生非常诱人的选项是非常吸引人的，例如，一个接近15%的储蓄率组合10%的回报率，能让一个人再工作20年后“早”退休。

The
problem  with  such  exercises  is  known  as  "garbage  in-garbage  out". 

这种练习的问题是众所周知的“垃圾进，垃圾出”。

 The
limitations of the formulae must be understood to use them. 

公式的限制因素是必须理解如何使用它们。

The financial world
abounds with stories of people and companies that put too much faith in their
equations without understanding the limits.

金融世界存在太多这样的故事，太多人和公司对他们的公式投入了太多的信心，而没有理解限制因素。

To give an example of a more realistic derivation, suppose we invest in a
broad market index and assume that future rates of return and future rates of
inflation will exactly match those of the past. 

给出一个更现实的推导，假如我们投资了一个市场指数，并且假设未来的回报率和通货膨胀率，和过去的相同。

Then we can pick a historical set of
returns and go through a calculation like above, except each year we use the
value  of  i  equal  to  that  of  the  market  return  for  the  corresponding  year.

那么我们就可以挑出一个历史回报的集合，进行上面的计算，每年里的i等于对应年里的市场回报率。

Additionally,  we  account  for  inflation  by  using  the  corresponding  historical
values,  increasing  p  by  the  rate  of  inflation  for  each  year. 

另外，我们算入历史通货膨胀率，用每年的通货膨胀增加p。

 This  can  be  done
numerically. The analytic equation is just a quick way to derive the result when
the values are assumed to be constant. 

这能计算出来。当值是常数的时候，分析公式是一个快速推导出结果的方法。

If calculated numerically with historic
data, it will quickly be found that the results N and M we want vary depending
on the range of years the historic data are taken from. 

通过计算历史数据，就会很快发现，我们想要的结果N和M，动态依赖于我们提取的历史数据。

Using data from 1980 to
2005 will be different from using data from 1935 to 1960.

使用1980到2005年的数据和1935到1960的数据是不同的。

 To compensate for
this, all possible periods from the past can be calculated.

通过这种补偿，所有可能的历史阶段都能被计算出来。

 This is called a Monte
Carlo simulation and there is one available at firecalc.com.

这叫做 Monte Carlo模拟，可以在firecalc.com里找到。

 Of course, this is
only accurate if the future repeats the past numbers. 

当然，这只有在未来重复过去数值是才会精确。

Still, plotting for all possible
historical periods shows how things have played out historically.

当然，绘制出所有历史周期里可能的图表，也能展示出穿透历史的东西。

 This exercise
can  be  repeated  for  different  markets  (domestic  equity,  international  equity,
commodities, real estate, timber, etc.) and for different investment methods (buy
and hold, dividends, Dogs of the Dow, etc.). 

这种练习也能用于其他市场（国内股票，国际股票，期货，固定资产，木材等等），或者不同的投资方法（买入和持有，股息，道琼斯狗股等等）。

It will, however, quickly become
clear that there are limits to how much the model can be fitted to the data. 

然而，这很快就会出现模型和数据有多匹配的限制。

The
objective of this exercise isn't to get a numerical value, but to get a sense of
possible future scenarios, assuming that the future will likely repeat the past in
one way or another.

这种对象的练习不会得到字面值，但是可以得到可能的未来情景的感觉，当假设未来会重复过去。

Numerical simulations require a lot of effort, so it's easier and more accurate
to account for inflation and return rates by setting i to be the real rate of return,
which  equals  the  nominal  rate  of  return  minus  inflation. 

数学模拟需要很多精力，计入通货膨胀后的i能得到更精确的结果，也就是i为名义利率减去通货膨胀率。

 Also,  consider  that
official inflation numbers may not necessarily pertain to you.

另外，考虑到官方的通货膨胀数字可能不适合你。

 Consumer inflation
is calculated based on what consumers buy and this will likely be quite different
from what you buy.

因为通货膨胀是通过消费者购买的商品来计算的，这可能和你购买的东西很不相同。

Given  this  uncertainty,  what  is  one  to  do?  Accept  that  the  worst  that  can
happen is that your investments thoroughly collapse, which will likely mean the
economy is dealing with mass unemployment or some other calamity. 

把这个作为不确定项，一个人会做什么？接受最糟糕的情况，你的投资会经历崩溃，这可能意味着经济上出现大规模失业和其他的灾难。

This in
turn means that whoever pays their expenses with work will also be in trouble.

这反过来意味着，那些为工作付钱的人也会陷入麻烦。

In particular, since they don't know how to live efficiently, they will be in bigger
trouble than you are, since they need to find high-income jobs, whereas you have
a much larger selection of low-income jobs.

特别的，因为他们不知道如何生活地更高效，他们的麻烦会比你大，因为他们需要找一个高收入的工作，然而，你有更多可选择的低收入工作。

 In such a disaster, you may be poor
with a low income, but everybody else will be broke with no income.

在这种灾难里，你可能会收入很低，但是，其他人会因为没收入而破产。

As an investor I live with the fact that sometimes markets go down, which
makes me feel poorer, but also makes stocks cheaper to buy.

作为一个投资者，我生活在这样的事实里，那就是，市场有时会走低，这让我感到变穷了，但是这也让买股票变的更便宜了。

 Sometimes they go
up, which makes me feel rich, but also makes stocks more expensive to buy. 

有些适合，市场走高，这让我感到更富了，但也让买股票变的更贵了。

We
can  calculate  expectation  values  forever  and  ever,  but  they  are  just  that--
expectations. 

我们可以对期望值永远地计算下去，但是，它们知识期望值。

Nothing can be guaranteed. Reaching financial independence and
having your money work for you at an early point means projecting out 60 years.

没有什么是保证好的。到达财务独立和让你的钱为你工作，意味着这个项目要在60年前开展。

A lot can happen in 60 years, including accidents that disable those who work
for money, or technological changes that render entire industries (typewriters,
telex machines, coach wagons, trolley cars, trans-Atlantic blimps, etc.) 

60年会发生很多事，包括，意外让一些为钱工作的人失去工作能力，或者技术改变了整个行业（打字员，接线员，四轮马车, 有轨电车, 跨大西洋小型飞船（齐柏林飞艇）等等）。

obsolete.
However, it's likely that it'll still be possible to invest in some manner even 60
years from now.

然而，投资一些60年后依然存在的东西也是可能的。

 There's no telling whether those investments will be in the stock
market,  government  debt,  personal  debt,  annuities,  mortgages,  timber,  real
estate, plankton farms, cattle, potable water, topsoil, or what have you. 

这里没有明确投资一定是，股票市场，政府债券，个人债券，养老金，房贷，木材市场，房地产市场，浮游生物农场， 养殖场， 饮用水， 地表土，或其他你所知道的。

It would
be a big mistake to think that a choice made now will also be valid only 10 years
from now, just as any particular investment vehicle I could suggest now will
probably  sound  silly  a  decade  from  now. 

一个巨大的误区就是认为，现在的决定只会在未来10年有效，就像我建议的任何投资汽车会在10年后听起来都非常傻。

 Thirty  years  ago  everybody  hated
stocks but loved gold.

13年前，人们讨厌股票喜欢黄金。

 Twenty years ago mutual funds were the hottest thing.

12年前共有基金是最火的东西。

Then after a decade of trending stock markets, which moved up no matter what
people owned, it was decided that the managers weren't needed and index funds
came into fashion--why do you need a manager if markets go up all on their
own? At that point nobody wanted to own gold. 

然后是经历了十年的股票市场上扬，也就是，无论人们持有什么，都上涨，这也就决定了不需要基金经理，并且指数基金非常流行，如果市场里所有的股票都上涨，那你为什么还需要一个经理呢？在这时候，没人想持有黄金。

In the past 10 years the market
has been in a trading range and now gold is more expensive than ever, so who
knows what the future will bring? My suggestion is not to presume that one can
pick an asset class and then stick with it forever.

在过去十年的市场交易中，黄金比任何时候都贵，所以，谁知道未来会带来啥？我的建议是，不要投资一种资产然后盯住它不放。

Despite this, there are a few established principles in the art of investing.

除了这个，这里还有一些关于投资艺术的必要原则。

Reward  is  often  correlated  with  risk,  where  risk  can  either  be  quantified  as
volatility or qualified as uncertainty (lack of knowledge). 

收益永远伴随着风险，这里的风险有两重意思，损失或者不确定（缺乏知识）。

This means that the
higher the return rate, the higher the risk of loss of capital.

高回报率也意味失去本金的高风险。

 Another principle,
however, says that risk is more related to skill and knowledge. Both of these
statements are true, but for different reasons. 

另一个原则是，风险和知识技能高度相关。对于不同的原因，这两者都对。

If you think about a fast race car,
it's a more risky vehicle to drive, but if you know how to drive it, the risk goes
down.

你可以想象一个超快的跑车，驾驶它的风险很高，但是，如果你知道如何驾驭它，风险就降低了。

There are two conclusions from this. 

对此，这里有两个总结。

First, having a margin of safety in terms
of principal is a good idea. 

首先，拥有原则上的安全边界是一个好主意。

In other words, having a low withdrawal rate is safer
than a high withdrawal rate, because the required rate of return is lower. 

换句话说，低撤出率要比高撤出率安全，因为要求的回报率低了。

A larger
fund thus allows for more safety. 

更大的资本池带来更多的安全。

Second, invest in what you understand rather
than what people tell you. This is the main reason I'm not telling you what to
invest in. If you don't know anything about investing, make it a point to learn! It
will be your new financial function in the world. 

第二，投资你理解的东西，而不是别人告诉你的东西。这也是为什么我不告诉你什么应该去投资。如果你不懂任何关于投资的东西，开始学！这将会是你在这个世界里的金融基础。

There's no hurry--as was shown
in  Financial  independence  and  investing,  the  investment  return  i  is  fairly
unimportant  during  the  accumulation  period  as  long  as  it  is  short. 

先不着急，就像在[财务独立和投资]()中展示的，投资回报率i，在积累阶段不重要，因为这段时间很短。

 A  lot  of
learning can happen during those years--people go to college and get degrees in
the time you have to learn how to manage your money.

这段时间里，很多事情会发生，人们上大学，获得学位，而你，用这段时间学习如何管理你的钱。

I invest in stocks because  I've  spent  almost  a  decade  reading  about  stock
investing. 

我投资股票是因为，我花了十多年的时间学习股票投资。

Conversely, I know little about real estate investment. If you're more
interested in real estate, perhaps you should invest in that instead.

相反，对于固定资产投资，我懂的很少。如果你对固定资产投资感兴趣，也许你应该转投这个方向。

 Some people
own timber land and every few years they sell lumber and live off the proceeds.

有些人持有林场，每几年通过销售木材维持生活。

The  reason  I  invest  in  stocks  is  a  combination  of  personal  interest,  personal
temperament, and historical accident. 

我投资股票的原因，是个人兴趣，个人性格，历史原因的结合。

It's not because I have determined they are
a superior investment by any means.

而不是因为股票投资最好。

Each  market  has  its  idiosyncratic  volatility  and  return  rates. 

每种市场都有它自己的独特的波动性和回报率。

 Timber,  for
instance, grows independent of what the market does, at a rate of about 3-4% per
year. 

例如木材，取决于市场走势，每年的回报率在3~4%。

 If  prices  are  low,  you  simply  wait  to  cut  until  they  are  high  again. 
 
 如果价格走低，你只需要等价格高以后再砍就行了。
 
  As
lumber remains a major part of the economy, it can be expected to rise in price in
sync with inflation.

因为伐木是经济中的重要部分，可以预期价格会和通货膨胀上涨同步。

 The US stock market has historically returned about 10%
nominally--other stock markets have returned different amounts.

美国股票市场的历史名义回报率在10%，其他股票市场有不同的回报率。

 Note that this
result  includes  a  significant  two-decade-long  bull  market  between  1983  and
2000. 

注意，这个结果是1983到2000，20年周期牛市的数据。

Other times, it has been flat for decades. In the periods 1905-1942, 1965-
1983 and 2000-2007 market return was either zero or negative. 

其他时间，它是停滞和下降的。在1905-1942， 1965-1983 和 2000-2007之间，市场的回报率是0或者负值。

Some of these
periods are really long! If the investment strategy relies on capital gains, as it
does in a buy and hold strategy, this will lead to failure if the withdrawal rate is
too high during years of decline, as too much stock will be liquidated when the
market is low. 

其中一些的周期是很长的！如果投资策略依赖资金链，像是购买和持有的策略，如果撤出率太高，那在经年的衰退中会导致失败，因为在市场低迷的时候，会有太多的流通股。

Monte Carlo simulations suggest that a withdrawal rate of 4% is
good for 30 years of inflation-adjusted expenses and that a withdrawal rate of
3% is good for 60 years or more. 

Monte Carlo模拟器给出的建议是，通货膨胀调整后的30年指数投资，撤出率最好是4%，60年是3%。

A withdrawal rate of 2% will last forever--that
is, if history repeats itself.

一个2%的撤出率会永远持续下去，那就是，历史在重复它自己。

In the long run, real estate always goes up ...at the rate of inflation! Despite
ups  and  down  and  bubbles  and  crashes,  the  rate  of  inflation is  the  long-term
trend. 

在很长的运转周期里，固定资产一直上涨...以通货膨胀的速率！不管上升还是下降，泡沫还是崩溃，通货膨胀率是一个长期的趋势。

This makes sense, because houses are nonproductive things. The reason
people  get  rich  in  real  estate  is  because  regulations,  or  lack  thereof,  allow
fantastic amounts of leverage which can be used during bubbles.

这是说的通的，因为房子是没有生产力的东西。人们通过固定资产致富的原因是监管，或者是缺乏监管，这让人们在泡沫期间制造了巨大的杠杆。

 However, if the
principal asset is in the form of rental units and rents can be raised with inflation,
inflation  is  taken  care  of. 

然而，如果资产的原则就是一种租借单元，那租借就会随着通货膨胀上升，通货膨胀才是需要关心的。

 The  withdrawal  rate  is  then  simply  based  on  the
average  fill  rate,  say  80%  or  4  out  of  5  units,  times  the  cash  flow  minus
maintenance costs and taxes divided by the value of the units (also see Rent or
own?).

撤出率可以简单基于补充率，可以说是80%或者4/5单位，现金流减去维护成本和税费，除以单位价值（参见[租赁还是持有]()）。


In summary, the organic growth of any sector seems to concentrate around
3% real growth. This is the number I would use as a safe withdrawal rate. 

总结的话，任何单元的自然增长率都在3%左右。这是我使用的安全的撤出率。

It's
difficult to judge whether this number will be representative of the next 50-100
years. 

很难说这个数值在未来的50-100年里是否还有代表性。

First, human population growth will peak out and probably decrease again
within  this  period. 

首先，人口数量会增长到极点，并且可能在这个阶段衰退。

 The  energy  available  from  fossil  fuels  that  underlies  the
economy  will  certainly  reverse  and  decline  as  fast  or  faster  than  it  has  been
growing. 

化石燃料需求可能会下降，经济会和它快速增长时一样快速衰退。

Maybe consumerism as  a  productivity  engine  will  cease  and  people
will begin to maintain their stuff or wear it out instead of buying new all the
time,  which  would  significantly  reduce  the  need  to  produce.  

可能消费主义作为生产引擎会熄火，人们开始维护他们已有的东西，使用它们而不是一直买新的，这可能会显著降低生产需求。

Conversely,
historical interest rates dating back thousands of years, for example, as measured
in repayment of a borrowed pig or borrowed grain at the next harvest, are easily
as high as 100% per year. 

另外，回溯到上百年前的历史利率，例如，通过偿付借来的一头猪，或者下个收获季归还借来的粮食，可以轻松到达100%每年。

If I was a skilled pig or grain banker, I would happily
assume  higher  rates,  but  for  someone  who  just  pays  attention  to  money
management  issues  for  a  couple  hours  every  month  or  so,  I  would  be
comfortable with 3% for now.

如果我是一个有技能的猪或者粮食银行家，我会非常乐意假设这样的高利率，但是对于那些每月投入几个小时，来关注资金管理的人来说，现在我可以非常自信地说是3%。
