We  have  come  to  a  point  where  spending  money  is  one  of  the  few
recognizable signs of success. For instance, spending half an hour in a traffic jam
getting  from  A  to  B  in  an  expensive  car  is  considered  more  successful  than
spending half an hour in a traffic jam getting from A to B in a cheap car. I'm not
sure  why  that  is.  Even  more  puzzling,  both  of  these  is  considered  more
successful than spending 25 minutes getting from A to B on a train or spending
20 minutes on a bicycle getting from A to B while passing cars in a traffic jam.
Similarly, it's considered more successful to sit on a couch in your home, if
there is an additional unused couch in an additional unused room, compared to a
house with no unused couches or no unused rooms. In the real estate market, a
house with a greater potential for unused rooms generally commands a higher
price  than  a  house  with  fewer  but  constantly  used  rooms.  Perhaps  there  is
personal fulfillment to be had in cleaning and maintaining a larger home? Or
perhaps the fulfillment comes from paying someone else to do it?
Many men spend as much time on manicured lawns as some women do on
manicured  nails.  I'm  not  sure  I  completely  understand  the  point  of  pouring
drinking water on a lush green lawn--not to mention the sidewalks--among the
rolling brown hills where we live, when lawns are inedible and all the birds in
the neighborhood seem to flock to our freely growing flowers, which don't need
any  watering.  However,  the  homeowners  association  refers  to  naturally
occurring vegetation as weeds; they think they know better than the birds.
Recently, much attention has been paid to great kitchens and great kitchen
appliances, while less attention is paid to great cooking and great cooks, except
those on TV. Why boil eggs in a pot when there are 350 varieties of electric egg
boilers available? A common misconception is that money is better--or is that
"more successfully?"--spent on granite countertops and restaurant-strength food
processors and burners than on cooking classes and practice. Who has the time
anyway?
This behavior is pervasive. People with more money than time buy $3,000
road racing bicycles with ultralight carbon frames to shave two pounds off the
bike, regardless of the fact that they themselves are probably at least 10 pounds
overweight, and only take a slow ride once a week because they lack the leg
power to go faster and the time to go more often. Compare this to the amateur
enthusiast with more time than money, who rides every day and thus has the


power  to  ride  his  much  less  expensive  bike  much  faster.  Who  enjoys  riding
more?
For recreation, many believe that saving for a year to drop a large sum on a
hectic one-week vacation in an exotic locale is more recreational than staying
closer to home and taking a month off to relax. A hectic tourist experience is
considered very successful.
A prerequisite for this kind of consumer success  is  spending  money.  This
money  must  either  be  inherited  or  earned.  If  that  isn't  possible,  it  will  be
borrowed. Most are not lucky enough to win the birth lottery and inherit their
money, and so they have to earn their money. Since acquiring the things that
demonstrate success only requires the short time needed to purchase some item,
and practically no time actually using or enjoying said item--that is, unless a
five-bedroom/three-bathroom home can be enjoyed remotely from one's cubicle
while at work--people can dedicate most of their time to earning money rather
than using and enjoying the things the money buys.
This results in having little time to develop skills other than spending money,
which  can  be  witnessed  by  the  confused  helplessness  modern  people
demonstrate towards solving problems without spending money or arguing on
the  phone  with  a  service  representative.  Consumers  are  used  to  buying  or
arguing their way out of problems. For $150 you can buy a propane grill at the
supermarket or you can spend $300 to have a plumber fix a drain, but a person
doing  these  things  has  learned  nothing.  Make  a  habit  out  of  this  and  you'll
become  helpless  and  deadly  afraid  of  losing  your  income,  as  the  work-spend
method only works as long as there is sufficient income.
Hence, so much effort is expended on earning money or finding ways to earn
money that people mostly don't fail to work 40, 80, or even more than 100 hours
each week, leaving little time to question their lives or otherwise get in trouble.
Of  course,  being  overworked  comes  with  its  own  problems,  such  as  stress,
insomnia, and high blood pressure, but typically these problems can be solved by
spending money to eliminate, or at least cover up, the symptoms--money that,
ironically, has to be earned by additional work. In many ways, modern society
seems to be using a slightly more complicated version of a Keynesian economic
stimulus scheme where the economy is stimulated by having some people dig a
hole, then having others fill it back in the next day. We create problems, spend
the next day solving them, and then claim we have made progress. We're even
following Keynes' suggestion quite literally when we dig resources out of the
ground,  fashion  them  into  consumer  objects,  temporarily  store  them  in  our
homes,  rarely  use  them,  and  eventually  replace  them  with  a  new  and  bigger
model, while sending the old and likely still functional object to a landfill--back

in the ground.6 Sure, this increases economic growth, which is a measure of how
busy people are turning their money over, but is being busy a good measure of
wealth?
For  years,  I've  been  wondering  whether  there  is  a  small  group  of  cynical
people who are pulling our strings and intentionally creating problems so that
others may solve them, or whether we're all pulling each other's strings because
we're too busy paying attention to day-to-day problems like paying bills, going
to work, and keeping up with all the shows on TV.
Seen  from  the  outside,  the  above-mentioned  behavior  makes  no  sense.
However, when seen from the inside, everything makes perfect sense, because
personal  values  and  personal  behavior  eventually  become  aligned  with  the
interest of the status quo. Having a job so that the bills get paid and one can go
back home every night and pass out in front of the TV is what the good life is all
about, right? Most people would agree, because most people can't imagine any
alternatives. They are, in other words, prisoners chained to the floor in Plato's
Cave.
To break away mentally, one needs to be conscious of the fact that one is
chained to the floor in Plato's Cave. The best way to understand this is to see the
cave--that  is,  your  current  perspective--from  a  different  perspective--namely,
looking into the cave from the outside. Here is what I see.
