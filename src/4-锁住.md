We  have  come  to  a  point  where  spending  money  is  one  of  the  few recognizable signs of success. 
我们已经到了，花钱是少数可辨识的成功迹象之一，的地步。

For instance, spending half an hour in a traffic jam getting  from  A  to  B  in  an  expensive  car  is  considered  more  successful  than spending half an hour in a traffic jam getting from A to B in a cheap car. 
例如，从 A 到 B ，在交通拥堵中花费半小时，乘坐昂贵的汽车被认为比乘坐廉价汽车更成功。

I'm not sure  why  that  is. 
我不知道为什么会这样。

 Even  more  puzzling,  both  of  these  is  considered  more successful than spending 25 minutes getting from A to B on a train or spending 20 minutes on a bicycle getting from A to B while passing cars in a traffic jam.
更令人费解的是，这两种方法都被认为比坐火车上花 25 分钟，或花 20 分钟骑自行车在交通堵塞中超车更成功。

Similarly, it's considered more successful to sit on a couch in your home, if there is an additional unused couch in an additional unused room, compared to a house with no unused couches or no unused rooms. 
同样，如果有额外未使用的房间，里面又有额外未使用的沙发，那么坐在家中的沙发上被认为更成功。

In the real estate market, a house with a greater potential for unused rooms generally commands a higher price  than  a  house  with  fewer  but  constantly  used  rooms. 
在房地产市场上，房间闲置潜力较大的房屋，通常比房间少但经常使用的房屋的价格更高。

 Perhaps  there  is personal fulfillment to be had in cleaning and maintaining a larger home? 
Or perhaps the fulfillment comes from paying someone else to do it? 
Many men spend as much time on manicured lawns as some women do on manicured  nails. 
也许在清洁和维护更大的房屋可以实现个人成就？
或者，这种满足感来自付钱让别人去做？
许多男人花在修剪草坪上的时间，和有些女人花在修剪指甲上的时间一样多。

 I'm  not  sure  I  completely  understand  the  point  of  pouring drinking water on a lush green lawn--not to mention the sidewalks--among the rolling brown hills where we live, when lawns are inedible and all the birds in the neighborhood seem to flock to our freely growing flowers, which don't need any  watering. 
我不理解将饮用水倒在绿色草坪上的意义——更不用说人行道了——在我们居住的连绵起伏的棕色山丘上，当草坪不可食用，附近的所有鸟类似乎都涌向我们自由生长的花朵，它们不需要浇任何水。

 However,  the  homeowners  association  refers  to  naturally occurring vegetation as weeds; they think they know better than the birds.
然而，房主协会将自然产生的植被称为杂草； 他们认为他们比鸟类更在行。

Recently, much attention has been paid to great kitchens and great kitchen appliances, while less attention is paid to great cooking and great cooks, except those on TV. 
近来，大厨房和大厨具备受关注，而除了电视上的那些饮食节目，大家又对烹饪关注甚少。

Why boil eggs in a pot when there are 350 varieties of electric egg boilers available? A common misconception is that money is better--or is that "more successfully?"--spent on granite countertops and restaurant-strength food processors and burners than on cooking classes and practice. 
煮蛋器有350多种，何必用锅煮蛋？ 一个常见的误解是钱多更好 - 或者说“更成功？” - 将钱花在大理石台面，餐厅，加工食品，燃烧器上，而不是烹饪课和练习上。

Who has the time anyway?
This behavior is pervasive. 
谁又有时间呢？
这种行为很普遍。

People with more money than time buy $3,000 road racing bicycles with ultralight carbon frames to shave two pounds off the bike, regardless of the fact that they themselves are probably at least 10 pounds overweight, and only take a slow ride once a week because they lack the leg power to go faster and the time to go more often. 
比有时间更有钱的人，会购买 3千美元的超轻碳纤维车架公路赛车，以减轻1公斤的自行车重量，尽管他们自己可能至少超重5公斤，并且每周只慢骑一次，因为他们腿部力量缺乏，没法骑得更快、骑得更频繁。

Compare this to the amateur enthusiast with more time than money, who rides every day and thus has the power  to  ride  his  much  less  expensive  bike  much  faster. 
相比之下，业余爱好者的时间比钱多，他们每天都骑车，因此有能力骑上他便宜得多的自行车，骑地更快。

 Who  enjoys  riding more?
For recreation, many believe that saving for a year to drop a large sum on a hectic one-week vacation in an exotic locale is more recreational than staying closer to home and taking a month off to relax. 
谁更喜享受骑行？
对于娱乐，许多人认为，一周忙碌的异国情调的假期，比节省一大笔钱，在家附近放松一个月更有趣。

A hectic tourist experience is considered very successful.
A prerequisite for this kind of consumer success  is  spending  money. 
忙碌的旅游体验被认为是非常成功的。
这种消费者成功的先决条件是花钱。

 This money  must  either  be  inherited  or  earned. 
 If  that  isn't  possible,  it  will  be borrowed. 
这笔钱必须是继承的或赚取的。
如果这不可能，它会是借的。

Most are not lucky enough to win the birth lottery and inherit their money, and so they have to earn their money. 
大多数人都没有幸运地赢得出生彩票，继承得到他们的钱，因此他们必须赚钱。

Since acquiring the things that demonstrate success only requires the short time needed to purchase some item, and practically no time actually using or enjoying said item--that is, unless a five-bedroom/three-bathroom home can be enjoyed remotely from one's cubicle while at work--people can dedicate most of their time to earning money rather than using and enjoying the things the money buys.
那些证明成功的东西，只需要很短的时间来购买，实际上没有时间使用或享受这些东西——也就是说，除非一个五居室/三居室的房子，能让一个人在工作时远程享受。人们将大部分时间用于赚钱，而不是使用和享受金钱购买的东西。


This results in having little time to develop skills other than spending money, which  can  be  witnessed  by  the  confused  helplessness  modern  people demonstrate towards solving problems without spending money or arguing on the  phone  with  a  service  representative. 
这导致除了花钱之外，几乎没有时间培养技能，这可以从现代人在不花钱就解决不了问题，或者与服务代表通话求助时的无助中看到。

 Consumers  are  used  to  buying  or arguing their way out of problems. 
消费者习惯于通过购买或求助来解决问题。

For $150 you can buy a propane grill at the supermarket or you can spend $300 to have a plumber fix a drain, but a person doing  these  things  has  learned  nothing. 
你可以花 150 美元在超市买一个丙烷烤架，或者花 300 美元让水管工修水管，但做完这些事情后，人们什么也没学到。

 Make  a  habit  out  of  this  and  you'll become  helpless  and  deadly  afraid  of  losing  your  income,  as  the  work-spend method only works as long as there is sufficient income.
养成这样的习惯，你会变得无助和害怕失去收入，因为工作支出法只有在有足够的收入时才有效。

Hence, so much effort is expended on earning money or finding ways to earn money that people mostly don't fail to work 40, 80, or even more than 100 hours each week, leaving little time to question their lives or otherwise get in trouble.
因此，人们在赚钱或寻找赚钱方式上花费了大量精力，以至于人们大多每周工作 40、80 甚至 100 小时以上，几乎没有时间质疑自己的生活陷入了困境。

Of  course,  being  overworked  comes  with  its  own  problems,  such  as  stress, insomnia, and high blood pressure, but typically these problems can be solved by spending money to eliminate, or at least cover up, the symptoms--money that, ironically, has to be earned by additional work. 
当然，过度工作也会带来一些问题，例如压力、失眠和高血压，但通常可以通过花钱消除，或至少掩盖症状，来解决这些问题——具有讽刺意味的是，钱必须通过额外的工作来赚取。

In many ways, modern society seems to be using a slightly more complicated version of a Keynesian economic stimulus scheme where the economy is stimulated by having some people dig a hole, then having others fill it back in the next day. 
在许多方面，现代社会似乎正在使用，稍微复杂一点的凯恩斯经济刺激计划，通过让一些人挖个坑，让其他人在第二天把它填上，来刺激经济。

We create problems, spend the next day solving them, and then claim we have made progress. 
我们创造问题，在第二天去解决它们，然后声称我们取得了进步。

We're even following Keynes' suggestion quite literally when we dig resources out of the ground,  fashion  them  into  consumer  objects,  temporarily  store  them  in  our homes,  rarely  use  them,  and  eventually  replace  them  with  a  new  and  bigger model, while sending the old and likely still functional object to a landfill--back in the ground.6 
我们完全遵循凯恩斯的建议，我们从地下挖掘资源，将它们塑造成消费对象，将它们暂时存放在我们的家中，很少使用它们，并最终用一个新的、更大的模型替换它们，同时把旧的并且可能仍然有效的，送到垃圾填埋场——埋回到地下。

Sure, this increases economic growth, which is a measure of how busy people are turning their money over, but is being busy a good measure of wealth?
当然，这会促进经济增长，这是衡量人们的钱流转忙碌程度的一个指标，但忙碌是否是衡量财富的一个很好的指标？

For  years,  I've  been  wondering  whether  there  is  a  small  group  of  cynical people who are pulling our strings and intentionally creating problems so that others may solve them, or whether we're all pulling each other's strings because we're too busy paying attention to day-to-day problems like paying bills, going to work, and keeping up with all the shows on TV.
多年来，我一直想知道是否有一小搓损人利己的人，在拉我们的线，故意制造问题，然后让其他人去解决它们，或者我们是否在互相拉线。因为我们太忙于付钱，或关注日常琐事，例如支付账单、上班和追剧，而没有注意到这一切。

Seen  from  the  outside,  the  above-mentioned  behavior  makes  no  sense.
从外部看，上述行为毫无意义。

However, when seen from the inside, everything makes perfect sense, because personal  values  and  personal  behavior  eventually  become  aligned  with  the interest of the status quo. 
然而，当从内部看时，一切都合乎情理，因为个人价值观和个人行为，最终会与现状的利益保持一致。

Having a job so that the bills get paid and one can go back home every night and pass out in front of the TV is what the good life is all about, right? Most people would agree, because most people can't imagine any alternatives. 
有一份工作来支付账单，并且可以每天晚上回家并在电视前昏倒，这就是美好生活的全部内容，对吧？大多数人会同意，因为大多数人无法想象任何替代方案。

They are, in other words, prisoners chained to the floor in Plato's Cave.
To break away mentally, one needs to be conscious of the fact that one is chained to the floor in Plato's Cave. 
换句话说，他们是被锁在柏拉图洞穴的囚犯。
要在精神上挣脱，人们需要意识到被锁在柏拉图洞穴的事实。

The best way to understand this is to see the cave--that  is,  your  current  perspective--from  a  different  perspective--namely, looking into the cave from the outside. 
理解这一点的最好方法是，从不同的角度看洞穴，即从外面看洞穴。

Here is what I see.

这些是我看到的。
