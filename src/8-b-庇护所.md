Many  houses  increasingly  serve  not  only  as  living  quarters  but  also  as
storage  areas  for  toy  collections, 

很多房子增加了服务项目，不仅作为起居的空间，还是收集玩具的存储空间，

 personal  libraries,  galleries  of  art  and  other
assorted  knick-knacks,  

个人图书馆，艺术品和其他小摆件的画廊，

small  supermarkets  (massive  refrigerators),  home
cinemas, and restaurant-sized kitchens which seem proportional in size to the
time the owners spend away from them, eating out.

小型超市（巨形冰箱），家庭影院，和餐馆级的厨房，这厨房大的和拥有者花的在外面吃饭的时间不相称。

 Outsource the storage and
live in something smaller.

占据完存储空间后，居住空间变小了。

Additionally, there's a preference for suburban housing that leaves people far
away from their jobs, unable to get anywhere without owning a car. 

额外的，人们更喜欢居住在郊区，让人们的住的和他们的工作很远，以至于没有车他们哪都去不了。

Getting a
driver's  license  and  a  car  at  16  is  a  rite  of  passage  into  the  "freedom"  of
adulthood. 

16岁的时候拥有驾驶证和一辆车，是通向成人世界“自由”的仪式。

 Without  access  to  public  transportation,  which  makes  little  sense
when  everything  is  spread  out,  it's  difficult  to  get  around  without  a  car.

因为没有公共交通工具可用，没有车去哪里都会非常困难。

Consequently, people growing up in these places often don't know how to ride a
bike.  

对应的，在这里长大的人也经常不知道如何骑自行车。

Many  can't  even  walk  greater  distances  than  a  driveway,  lacking  the
stamina, the proper clothing, and perhaps even the faith that they can engage in
the vigorous labor of walking three miles without consulting a physician first.

很多人甚至不能走到比从家到公路更远的距离，缺乏爆发力，合适的着装，甚至缺乏信心自己有走3英里的体力。

Houses  are  surrounded  by  asphalt,  unproductive  vegetation,  and  artificial
"lakes" which cover valuable agricultural soil.

房子被柏油，没有产出的植物，覆盖了有价值农业土地的人造湖所包围。

 The unproductive vegetation is
specifically selected to be unproductive to avoid having to pick up fruit from the
ground. 

没产出的植物是被特意挑选出来的，以避免需要从地上去拣去水果。

 Why  get  free  fruit  from  the  garden  when  you  can  pay  for  it  at  the
supermarket  5-10  miles  away? 

当你可以开5-10英里到超市里花钱买水果时，为什么要从花园里获取免费水果？

 In  addition,  the  vegetation  is  often  nonnative,
which  requires  significant  amounts  of  intervention.67 

另外，植物也经常是不自然的，这就要求很多的人为干预。

 Consider,  for  example,
how lawns are first fertilized and watered, then once they grow accordingly, they
are cut down.

考虑一下，例如，草坪开始是施肥和浇水，一旦它们长起来，就把它们砍倒。

The  houses  are  poorly  built,  but  made  to  look  expensive  with  fake  brick
walls and concrete columns. 

房子建造的并不好，但是通过假的砖墙和混凝土块营造一种昂贵的视觉效果。

The optimal design for an efficient house is almost
always rectangular with as few corners as possible, as corners are structurally
weak and admit cold. 

最有效率的房屋设计永远是最少角的矩形，因为角是结构的弱点和容纳寒冷。

Speaking of cold, housing is typically poorly insulated, if
at all. 

说到寒冷，房屋通常隔热不佳。

This is a viable strategy in a world of cheap energy--a world that may not
last much longer--with its central heating and cooling.

这在一个能源廉价世界是一个可行的策略，随着中央供热和制冷，这种世界可能不会持续很长时间了。

 With cold (warm) walls,
the  air  temperature  has  to  be  raised  above  (lowered  below)  normal  to
compensate for the radiative heat loss (gain) from the walls.

随着墙体的冷热，空气温度上升和下降。

 As a consequence,
as money spent on insulation has gone down, room temperature in the winter
(summer) has gone up (down), and the cost of living has gone up.

接着，因为没有在隔热上花钱，屋子的温度在夏天和冬天上升和下降，生活的花费就会上升。

The problem is that there's a cultural perception of what constitutes a "good
house,"  and  despite  or  perhaps  due  to  all  the  failures  mentioned  above,  thesuburban house with a lawn, a picket fence, and a car or three (one for each
person over legal driving age) parked in the driveway is the pinnacle to attain.

问题就是，文化观点上什么构成了“好房子”，可能是由于上面提到的所有失败点，有草坪，有篱笆，有一个或三个（一旦过了合法驾驶的年龄，每人一个车位）停车位的郊区的房子，是这种标准的顶点。

Like a peacock's tail, and in general for status symbols, the more nonproductive
and  inefficient  they  are,  the  better  status  symbols  they  make. 

像孔雀的尾巴一样，在通常的象征符号里，一个人越是低产和无效，他们的象征符号做的越好。

 After  all,  if
someone can afford to use a lot of resources in non-or even counterproductive
ways, he must be rich, powerful, strong, etc.

毕竟，如果一个人可以负担得起使用一堆资源，甚至以反生产的方式，他一定是富有，权势，强大的等等。

 As the suburban house is able to
absorb tremendous amounts of money, it makes an excellent status symbol.

郊区的房子要消耗一大堆的钱，这构成了一个完美的象征符号。

Considering that the median home is priced above $150,000, a mortgage rate
of 5% will cost the homeowner $9,663 each year, which is more than the entire
budget of the lifestyle described in this chapter. 

考虑一下，中等的房子价格超过15万美元，贷款利率是5%，每年就会花掉房主9663美元，这远远超过了本章中描述的生活方式的预算。

Now add on insurance (nobody
is going to lend money on an uninsured house), taxes, possible home association
fees,  and  general  maintenance,  that's  another  50%  on  top  of  the  mortgage
payments. 

现在再加入保险费（没人打算给一个没上保险的房子提供贷款），税，房子附属物的费用，维护费用，这种贷款上面又增加了50%的费用。

 This  comprises  a  huge  opportunity  cost  in  foregone  investment
returns, which will be nonexistent. 

这巨大地压缩了未来对于投资的回报，因为投资根本不存在。

Any retirement accounts will  be  cordoned
off, and therefore, having no assets to speak of and no investment cash flow, the
homeowner  will  be  forced  to  pay  for  his  house  with  wage  income  over  the
duration of the mortgage. 

所有的退休账户被隔离在外了，也就是，没有资本去谈及，也没有投资的现金流，在贷款期间，屋主会被强制支付他的工资。

 Renting such a home is obviously not much wiser.

租这样一套房子明显不是那么明智。

Except during extreme bubbles (see Rent or own?), renting costs approximately
the same as owning, since the owner passes along the costs.

除非是在极端泡沫期间（参见[租赁还是持有]()），租的成本大概接近持有的成本，因为持有者传递了花费。

Either buying or renting a home that is priced at several times your annual
income is a huge financial mistake. 

无论买还是租一个房子，价格是你年收入的几倍时都是巨大的经济错误。

No business, not any that lives long, would
obtain  long-term  debt  that  exceeds  50%  of  their  equity  and  spend  it  all  on
nonproductive  overhead,  yet  homeowners  consider  debts  exceeding  their
nonproductive equity by 400%, conservative.

没有任何的生意是终生的，这将会获得一个扩展了50%的超前消费的债务，而对于房屋持有者来说他们的债务可能会扩展400%，保守估计。

Hence,  a  trophy  house,  or  a  trophy  anything  for  that  matter,  is  not  very
compatible with financial independence. 

然而，一个可能抬高身价的房子，或者任何抬高身价的东西，都不会和财务独立相兼容。

Giving up the trophy house in exchange
for financial independence can result in alienation from those who are heavily
socialized  to  middle-class  status  symbols.  

放弃抬高身价的房子换来财务独立，会让那些重度依赖身份标志的中产在社交中被疏远。

However,  there  are  significant
subcultures  in  which  you  can  easily  find  friends  and  partners  who  put  less
importance on curb appeal and one-hour commutes.

然而，有大量你可以轻易找到朋友和伴侣的亚文化，他们并不把房屋外观和一小时通勤看得很重。

Therefore,  there  is  a  deliberate  choice  to  make  between  financial
independence  and  the  standard  house  engineered  to  give  the  appearance  of
enhanced "socioeconomic status." You can have one or the other, but not both. 

也就是，在经济独立和房屋驱动的“社会经济学状态”中需要权衡抉择。你只能二选一。

In
other  words,  living  in  something  significantly  more  economically  efficient,
smaller and more conveniently located than what your peers are living in is key
to financial independence.

换句话说，生活中一个更加经济高效的状态中，小巧和方便安置的生活空间是经济独立的关键。

For most people a home is basically only a place to sleep, eat, shower, and
keep stuff (see Things). 

对于大多数人，房子只是一个睡觉，吃饭，洗澡和保存东西的地方（参见[物品]()）。

Realize that you could choose between having an extra
bedroom  and  having  an  extra  $200  per  month.68  

意识到这一点，你可以选择有额外卧室并且需要每月多付200到的房子。

It's  quite  possible  that  themarginal  utility  (see  Building  blocks  and  Sigmoids,  logistic  curves,  and  the
maximum power principle) of $200 is higher elsewhere in the budget.

这200美元的预算在其它方面非常有可能获得巨大的功效（参见[S型曲线逻辑曲线和最大能量原则]()）。

To  become  financially  independent  of  a  $200/month  expense  requires
investments  between  $60,000  and  $80,000  (see  Financial  independence  and
investing). 

为了实现财务独立，200美元/月的额外支出要求6万~8万美元的投资（参见[财务独立和投资]()）。

This is the so-called latté effect on a large scale, except that instead of
a daily superfluous cup of luxury coffee, we are talking about a superfluous bed
or bathroom that is rarely used. 

在大规模上这又被叫做拿铁效应，和不必要的每天一杯的奢侈咖啡比，我们谈论的是几乎不会使用的不必要的床位和卧室。

How many years will it take you to save this
much more money?
I  think  that  a  good  guideline  per  person  for  living  arrangements  is  $200-
350/month/person  or  about  10-15%  of  your  net  salary.  

它会花费你多少年的存款？我想一个比较好的标准线是200美元-300美元每人每月或者10%-15%你的网络收入。

If  anyone  tries  to
convince you to spend more, they're trying to sell you into a lifetime of wage
work (see this figure). 

如果有人试着劝说你多花点，其实他们是在尝试将你的生命卖给薪资工作（参见[这张图片]()）。

In some places this buys more than in other places.

在一些地方，这能买到比其他地方多的东西。

 As far
as I'm concerned, the percentage is absolute. If I want to live in a "nicer place" it
simply  translates  into  a  smaller  place.  

正如目前我讲到的，比例是相对的。如果我想生活在一个“不错的地方”，它就简单地翻译成了一个小地方。

For  instance,  in  New  York  or  San
Francisco, this just about gets you a room in an apartment shared with 4 others.

例如，在纽约或者旧金山，这可以给你提供一个4个人合租的小公寓。

In other parts of the country, this figure will buy you an entire house.

在国内的其他地方，这可能够你买一套房子。

When  I  started  out  in  grad  school,  I  was  paying  about  $275/month  for  a
small room with a sink. 

当我研究生毕业以后，我花275美元每月租了一个带洗手池的小房间。

I shared the kitchen, toilets, and showers with 18 other
people. 

我们18个人共享厨房，厕所，和淋浴。

This was close to the downtown area of one of the most expensive cities
in the world. 

这个地方接近市中心，是世界上房租最高的地方。

When I relocated for work, I moved into my very own apartment
for $400/month. 

当我换工作以后，我搬进了一个400美元每月的公寓。

Then I moved into a house together with my future wife for
$330/person/month.  

然后我和我未来的妻子搬进的平房里，房子每人每月花330美元。

We  then  made  the  mistake  of  moving  into  a  house  at
$700/person/month. 

我们后来犯了一个错误，搬进了一个房子每人每月花700美元的房子。

That lasted a year with stagnating savings as a result. We
currently spend $237/person/month.

结果一年里我们的储蓄都止步不前。我们现在的房子每人每月花237美元。

The  idea  is  therefore  to  seriously  consider  whether  your  current  living
arrangements are optimally aligned with your liberty and pursuit of happiness. 

想法是认真考虑你当前的生活安排，将你的自由和对幸福的追求对齐优化。

Is
your money best spent on an extra bedroom or five years of freedom? 

把你的钱花在额外的卧室上还是5年的自由？

If not
aligned, doing so should be of primary importance. 

如果不对齐，这么做（额外的卧室）应会是第一重要的。

Unless you revel in interior
decorating--and if so, why not decorate other people's homes and get paid for it?-
-home maintenance and repair or cleaning, most activities don't require a large
home. 

除非你痴迷于内部装修，并且如果这样的话，为啥你要花钱给别人的房子做装修？房屋的维护，修理，清洁，大多数获得并不要求一个大房子。

 Resources like money and time spent earning money may therefore be
better spent on activities you enjoy, rather than things you possess. 

像钱和时间这样的资源，最好花在你享受的活动上，而不是支配你的东西上。

Even if you
like "entertaining", you could simply rent a restaurant the few times a month or
year that you do. 

如果你热爱“娱乐”，你大可以简单地每年每月租几次酒店。

If you do it more often, open a bed and breakfast, or consider
expanding the realm of entertainment beyond eating.

如果你经常这么做，下了床就是吃，或许你可以考虑一下吃以外的其他娱乐范围。
