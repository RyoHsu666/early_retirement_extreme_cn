How would you like to manage your money? Do you prefer to do it yourself or  outsource  the  job?  Do  you  like  accounting  and  reading  reports  or  are  you more  interested  in  remodeling  bathrooms  and  dealing  with  tenants?  Maybe you're more interested in owning farmland for rent or windmills or solar panels producing  electricity,  a  blog/blogging  network,  or  other  low-maintenance ventures?  Until  you  know  the  answer  to  these  questions,  don't  buy  anything.
你想如何管理你的钱？你喜欢自己做还是把工作外包？你喜欢会计和阅读报告，还是对改建浴室和与房客打交道更感兴趣？也许你对拥有农田出租、风车或太阳能电池板发电、博客/博客网络或其他低维护风险更感兴趣？在你知道这些问题的答案之前，不要买任何东西。
Take time to figure out the answer while accumulating cash.
在积累现金的同时，花时间找出答案。
If M in this equation is small, the strength of i, which depends on your investing skills, doesn't matter that much while saving.
如果这个等式中的M很小，那么i的强度（取决于你的投资技巧）在储蓄时并不重要。
I saved cash at a measly interest rate in a bank account for  four  years  while  reading  about  stock  investing before  I  began  investing  in stocks.
在我开始投资股票之前，我在阅读有关股票投资的书籍时，以微薄的利率在银行账户里存了四年的现金。
This  doesn't  mean  that  you  have  to  invest  in  stocks  too.
这并不意味着你也必须投资股票。
Furthermore, because I invest in stocks now doesn't mean I will be doing so for the next 50 years.
此外，因为我现在投资股票并不意味着我未来50年也投资股票。
If  circumstances  change,  I'll  change.
如果情况改变，我也会改变。
Study  the  alternatives.

111 This is what investors do.
投资者就是这么做的
This is what I do.
我就是这么做的。

Beware  of  the  promise  of  high  returns  in  general  or  brand  new  untested methods of investing.
谨防高回报的承诺或全新的未经测试的投资方法。
It's easy to get burned by this.
这很容易引火上身。
If consistent returns of 12% or even 24% per year are possible, the fund size can be small indeed.
如果每年12%甚至24%的持续回报率是可能的，那么基金规模可能会很小。
However, if  a  new  or  exotic  method  (pig  lending?)  promises  high  returns,  it's  almost guaranteed  that  those  returns  will  go  down  as  more  people  buy  in,  or  that  the returns  are  simply  not  sustainable  because  the  risks  are  far  higher  than anticipated.
然而，如果有一种新的或异国情调的方法（养猪贷款？）承诺高回报，几乎可以保证，随着越来越多的人买入，这些回报会下降，或者回报根本不可持续，因为风险远远高于预期。

That  said,  if  you  decide  that  you  have  no  interest  in  managing  your  own money,  it's,  as  always,  possible  to  pay  money  to  compensate.
这就是说，如果你决定对管理自己的钱没有兴趣，你可以一如既往地花钱来做这件事。
You  can  pay another  person  to  manage  your  money,  you  can  pay  for  your  mistakes,  or  you can pay in terms of opportunity costs for having an underperforming portfolio.
你可以付钱给另一个人来管理你的资金，你可以为你的错误买单，或者你可以为表现不佳的投资组合支付机会成本。

In all these, the cost relative to the withdrawal rate will be high because the withdrawal rate is  generally  low.
在所有这些情况下，与提取率相关的成本将很高，因为提取率通常较低。
Typical  management  fees are asset-based and could  easily  be  1%,  which  has  to  come  out  of  the  withdrawal  rate.
典型的管理费是基于资产的，很容易达到1%，这必须从提取率中得出。
112  For example, if the withdrawal rate is 4% and 1% goes to fees, it only leaves 3% for expenses;  in  other  words,  25%  of  the  cash  flow is  spent  on  management  fees.
例如，如果提取率为4%，其中1%是费用，那只剩下3%；换句话说，25%的现金流用于管理费。
With  fees  this  high,  it  means  that  the  fund  has  to  be  proportionally  larger  to support  financial  independence.
费用如此之高，这意味着该基金必须按比例扩大，以支持财务独立。
Is  it  worth  it  to  spend  time  and  effort  learning how to manage your money yourself rather than increasing M? That's up to you.
花时间和精力学习如何自己管理自己的钱，而不是增加收入，值得吗？这取决于你。
