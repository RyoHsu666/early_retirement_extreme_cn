Spend much time reading about budgets or engaging in discussions about lifestyles and you'll notice that most of them focus on the difference between needs  and  wants. 
花很多时间阅读预算或参与生活方式的讨论，你会注意到其中大多数都关注需求和欲望之间的差异。
This  often  results  in  normative  discussions  of  what  other people  should  need  or  want,  which  usually  degenerate  into  discussions  about what is possible and what is not possible. 
在常规的讨论中结果经常是他人应该需求和欲望，这经常退化成什么是可能的和什么是不可能的。
The  fact  that  it  is  so  hard  to  agree  on  which  is  which  suggests  that  the differentiation has become meaningless and thus irrelevant. 
事实是争论哪个是哪个是非常困难的，建议的不同会变得无意义和不相关。
There are no such things as needs and wants. 
没有即欲望又需求的东西。
It's therefore pointless to argue about the difference or make lists of needs and wants. 
争论其中的不同是和列出欲望和需求的清单是没有意义的。
The problem is that needs and wants don't fit on two different lists. 
问题是欲望和需求不适合两个不同的列表。
They fit on one list where they're ranked according to value rather than price (see Economical). 
它们适合一个根据价值而不是价格排列的列表（参见经济）。
Needs and wants are different in degree, not in kind. 
欲望和需求是程度上的不同，而不是类别上的不同。
Consider, for example, shelter. 
Here the list of choices may look like this: 
考虑一下，例如，庇护所。可选的列表看起来像这样： 
1. Sleeping under open air. 
1. 睡在露天下。 
2. Sleeping under a tarp, basha, or hootchie. 
2. 睡在防水布下，basha帐下（A形天幕，四角固定到地面），或者hootchie帐下（A形天幕，四角悬空固定）。 
3. Living in a tent. 
3. 生活在帐篷里。 
4. Couch surfing. 
4. 沙发客。 
5. Living in a shack or a cabin. 
5. 生活在棚子里或者小木屋里。 
6. Living in a ship cabin or truck cab. 
6. 生活在船舱或者卡车驾驶室里。 
7. Living in a car or a boat. 
7. 生活在车里或者船里。 
8. Living in an RV. 
8. 生活在野营车里 
9. Sharing a room with other people. 
9. 和其他人共享房间。 
10. Having your own room. 
10. 有你自己的房间。 
11. Sharing an apartment with other people. 
11. 和其他人共享公寓。 
12. Having your own apartment. 
12. 拥有你自己的公寓。 
13. Sharing a house with other people. 
13. 和他人共享房子。 
14. ... 
14. …… 
On this scale there is no demarcation of when a need becomes a want. 
在这种尺度上没有什么时候需求变成欲望的界限。
Each step is slightly different and slightly more expensive than the previous step, with no clear indication of what the bare minimum is, other than having somewhere to sleep. 
每一阶和上一阶不一样也更贵，但是对于在某个地方睡觉来说，没有清晰的指示说什么是最简的。
At what point, then, does a want become a need? 
在哪个点上，使欲望变成了需求？ 
It could be argued that sleeping under open air in Alaska or Finland will kill you, and that some form of shelter is therefore a need. 
这可能会引发争论说在阿拉斯加或者芬兰露天睡觉会冻死人，那一些形式的避难所就变成了需求了。
However, it's possible for people living in Finland or Alaska to move south so shelter isn't an absolute need. 
然而，生活在芬兰或阿拉斯加的人可以搬到南方去，所以庇护所也不是绝对需求的。 
Rather, it's shelter in Finland or Alaska that is an absolute need--insofar that staying alive is a need,  
相反，在芬兰或阿拉斯加庇护所是决定需求的——目前为止活下去是需求的， 
but nobody needs to live in Finland or Alaska, even though I'm sure those are nice places.45 
但是没人需求生活在芬兰或阿拉斯加，即使我确定那两个地方都很不错。
Even though the rankings on this list probably match the rankings of most people, it's by no means universal. 
尽管这个列表可能匹配大多数人的排列，但这不意味着放之四海而皆准。
Having experienced the freedom of living in an RV or a boat for a while, some people would never dream of substituting this for a 4,000square-foot McMansion with its endless cleaning and maintenance issues, and the need for walkie-talkies to find lost family members. 
有一点生活在露营车或者船上的经历后，一些人再也不会梦想着拥有一个4000尺的豪宅，这豪宅需求无尽的清洁和维护，需求来回来去地寻找失散的家人。
The list is individual,  because  any  choice  has  consequences  in  other  domains  (see Contingency goal-setting). 
这个列表是独立，因为任何选择都有其他领域的后果（参见应变目标设定）。
For each individual, there are similar lists for eating, clothing, transportation, health, time, tools, toys, activities, status, etc. 
对于每个独立事项，列出吃、穿、健康、时间、工具、玩家、活动、状态等等列表都是相同的。
, each ranging from essentially zero cost to more than one can imagine. 
每个都可以从必要但零花费到一个人难以想象。
These can also be classified into tangibles like  air,  water,  food,  sanitary,  shelter,  communication,  transport,  health,  and security,  and  intangibles,  like  time,  relationships,  affiliation,  power,  and achievement. 
这也能被分类成可感知的像空气、水、食物、医疗、庇护所、通信、交通、健康和安全，不可感知的，像时间、关系、智力、权力和成就。
Some of these, like security and sanitation, we take for granted living in the developed world. 
其中一些，像安全和医疗，我们因为生活在发达国家而获得大量好处。
For others, except perhaps air and clean water, there's a large range of possible "consumption" levels. 
对于其他，除了空气和清洁水一维，它们有巨大的“消费”等级排位。
For instance, the eating list ranges from roadkill and dumpster diving, to industrially processed "food," to gourmet meals and fine dining. 
举例来说，列表可以从路边杀手和垃圾食品，到工业加工食品，到精美丰盛的一餐。
Clothing ranges from going naked to owning just one set of clothes, to owning massive wardrobes full of shoes and tailor- made suits. 
衣服可以从裸体，到只有一套衣服，到拥有巨大的一柜子的衣服鞋子和手工打造的套装。
Transportation ranges from walking barefoot to driving a "hooptie," to private airplanes and megayachts. 
交通可以从赤足赶路到驾驶一辆“破车”，到私人飞机和豪华游艇。
Health ranges from being strong (physically and mentally), to being on prescription medicines, to being entirely dependent on advanced medical infrastructure. 
健康可以从变强（身体上和心理上），到轻微的医疗辅助，到完全依赖先进的医疗设施。
Time ranges from being a galley slave, to working 8-10-hour days in a tolerable job, to doing what you want, which may or may not include what is otherwise classified as work. 
时间可以从完全被奴役，到每天工作8-10个小时的能忍受的工作，到做你想做的，这可能或不能被分类成工作。
Completing these lists is left as an exercise for the reader. 
完成这些列表就交给读者练习了。
In fact, such an exercise is highly recommended. 
事实上，如此的练习是高度推荐的。
Try to make it as wide-ranging as possible and as complete as possible. 
尝试把它做得越宽越好，越完整越好。
It may range wider and include more dimensions than suggested above. 
它可能会宽到包含比上面建议的多的领域。
Each level on each list has a price and a value which is individually unique. 
每个列表的每个层级都有独立唯一的价格和价值。
The ultimate goal is maximizing total value while minimizing the total price. 
终极的目标是最大化总价值和最小化总价格。
While the locked-in lifestyle described in The lock-in provides a default choice of  levels,  it's  possible  to  choose  one's  levels  very  differently. 
在锁住一节里描述的锁住的生活方式里只提供了一个默认的选择层级，这可能让一个人的选择截然不同。
For  instance, instead of choosing a career in a cubicle, a five-bedroom/three-bathroom home on  a  30-year  mortgage,  and  a  new  TV  on  credit,  one  may  choose  financial independence and early retirement. 
举例来讲，除了选择一个小隔间的职业，一个五个卧室三个浴室的房子和30年的贷款，一个信用卡买的新电视，一个人可能选择财务独立和尽早退休。
