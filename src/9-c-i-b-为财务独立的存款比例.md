An emergency fund represents financial independence on the simplest level, because  it  means  that  given  an  emergency,  there's  no  need  to  finance  (borrow money to replace) living expenses.
紧急基金在最简单的层面上代表着财务独立，因为这意味着在紧急情况下，没有必要为生活费用提供资金（借钱来替代）。
Let us consider the required savings rate to replace both needs and wants.
让我们考虑所需的储蓄率，以取代需求和欲望。
If the  savings  rate  is  10%,  needs  and  wants  total  90%  and  therefore  it  takes (90/10=) 9 years of working to save enough money to spend on needs and wants for 1 year of not working.
如果储蓄率为10%，则需求和欲望总计90%，因此需要（90/10=）9年的工作时间才能攒下足够的钱来满足一年不工作的需求和欲望。
If the savings rate is 20%, needs and wants total 80% and so it takes (80/20=) 4 years of working to replace 1 year of spending.
如果储蓄率是20%，那么需求和欲望总共80%，因此需要（80/20=）4年的工作来取代1年的支出。
If the savings rate is 50%, 1 year of working saves enough money to take 1 year off.
如果储蓄率为50%，那么一年的工作可以节省足够的钱，来休假一年。
This  table  shows  the  calculations  for  all  cases  using  the  formula  (1-r)/r  (for example, for 20%, r=0.20 so (1-0.2)/0.2=4) for  the top  half  and  r/(1-r)  for  the bottom half. Note that this calculation doesn't consider emergency and retirement savings.  If  you  like,  include  retirement  savings  and  emergency  fund  savings under general spending.
该[表]()显示了使用公式(1-r)/r来计算上表， r/(1-r)来计算下表，例如，对于20%，r=0.20 所以(1-0.2)/0.2=4。请注意，这个计算不考虑急诊科和退休储蓄。如果你愿意，可以将退休储蓄和应急基金储蓄纳入一般支出。
