You  may  want  to  put  in  an  external  constraint  that  all  dirty  clothes  should comprise  a  full  laundry  load  to  minimize  laundry  machine  use  (wear,  money, water, electricity).

If you use machines, figure full loads.

This will likely be two loads,  a  colder  one  and  a  warmer  one.

If  you're  two  people  doing  laundry together,  the  loads  will  be  done  twice  as  often,  which  makes  it  possible  to  get away with only owning half as many clothes.

Three people means one-third and so  on.

If  you  handwash,  you  can  get  away  with  one  to  three  sets  of  clothes, depending on your drying times.

Many synthetic fabrics, such as "no-wrinkle," require little maintenance and dry quickly.

In this case, it's possible to make do with only one set of clothing which dries overnight while one sleeps-- this is the holy grail of wardrobe minimalism.

To wash a full load of clothes "by hand," put it in a sealed bucket with some water and detergent and drive it down a bumpy road.

Don't forget the rinse cycle.

This is done by transferring the clothes to a clean bucket on the way back.

If you don't have a bumpy road available, you can use a plastic container (10gal.

) and a plunger.

If  you  don't  have  a  plunger,  attach  a  shovel  handle  to  a  wooden  stool and  twist  it  around.

Alternatively,  you  can  buy  electric  contraptions  that  will agitate  the  clothes  for  you.

These  are  called  washing  machines  and  cost  a  few hundred bucks.

They usually need to be repaired every few years.

Commercial  detergent  is  an  interesting  concoction  of  sodium  carbonate, borax, and inactive ingredients (color agents), all of which are very inexpensive, plus  advertising  campaigns,  management  salaries,  distribution  systems,  etc.

, which  comprise  most  of  the  cost.

To  make  your  own,  you  only  need  sodium carbonate, which is sold as either washing soda (check out the art supply section) or pH booster (next to the pool supplies), borax (laundry detergent section), and grated  bar  soap  (grate  your  own).

Mix  these  in  a  1:1:1  ratio.

A  load  requires about a tablespoon of this mixture.

If you want liquid detergent, simply mix with water  and  heat  up  the  concoction.

Notice  that  the  liquid  version  may  form clumps.

This is not a functional problem--just shake the container prior to use.

To dry the clothes, use a clothesline.

A clothesline is either a piece of string tied between two points or an expensive contraption available at "green living" outlets.

If you stick with the piece of string, the clothesline will be working for you, rather than the other way around.

Some consider hanging clothes up to be arduous,  backbreaking  labor  involving  about  50  deep  knee  bends  from  the hamper to the line.

Avoid this (and the hamper) by putting the clothes directly on your shoulder (big items like pants and shirts) or in your hand (small items like socks and underwear).

Then walk over to the line and transfer them either from the hand or the shoulder as you walk along the line.

There's no reason to bother with pegs unless the wind is blowing strongly.
