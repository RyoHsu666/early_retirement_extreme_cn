You  may  want  to  put  in  an  external  constraint  that  all  dirty  clothes  should comprise  a  full  laundry  load  to  minimize  laundry  machine  use  (wear,  money, water, electricity).
你可能想要加入一个外部约束，即所有脏衣服都包含进一个完整的洗衣负载，以尽量减少洗衣机的使用（磨损、金钱、水、电）。
If you use machines, figure full loads.
如果你使用机器，计算满负荷。
This will likely be two loads,  a  colder  one  and  a  warmer  one.
这可能是两个负荷，一个较冷的负荷和一个较暖的负荷。
If  you're  two  people  doing  laundry together,  the  loads  will  be  done  twice  as  often,  which  makes  it  possible  to  get away with only owning half as many clothes.
如果你是两个人一起洗衣服，那么衣服的数量会增加一倍，这就使得你可以只拥有一半的衣服。
Three people means one-third and so  on.
三个人意味着三分之一，以此类推。
If  you  handwash,  you  can  get  away  with  one  to  three  sets  of  clothes, depending on your drying times.
如果你用手洗，你可以拿走一到三套衣服，这取决于你晾干的时间。
Many synthetic fabrics, such as "no-wrinkle," require little maintenance and dry quickly.
许多合成纤维织物，如“无褶皱”，维护很少和快速干燥。
In this case, it's possible to make do with only one set of clothing which dries overnight while one sleeps-- this is the holy grail of wardrobe minimalism.
在这种情况下，你可以只穿一套衣服，睡一觉早上醒来衣服就干了——这是衣橱极简主义的圣杯。

To wash a full load of clothes "by hand," put it in a sealed bucket with some water and detergent and drive it down a bumpy road.
要“用手”洗一大堆衣服，把它放在一个装有水和洗涤剂的密封桶里，然后把它开到一条崎岖不平的路上。
Don't forget the rinse cycle.
不要忘记冲洗周期。
This is done by transferring the clothes to a clean bucket on the way back.
在回来的路上把衣服转移到一个干净的桶里。
If you don't have a bumpy road available, you can use a plastic container (10gal.) and a plunger.
如果没有崎岖不平的道路，可以使用塑料容器（40L）还有一个塞子。
If  you  don't  have  a  plunger,  attach  a  shovel  handle  to  a  wooden  stool and  twist  it  around.
如果你没有塞子，就把铲子手柄固定在木凳上，然后把它扭转过来。
Alternatively,  you  can  buy  electric  contraptions  that  will agitate  the  clothes  for  you.
或者，你也可以买一些能为你搅动衣服的电器。
These  are  called  washing  machines  and  cost  a  few hundred bucks.
这些被称为洗衣机，售价几百美元。
They usually need to be repaired every few years.
它们通常需要每隔几年修理一次。

Commercial  detergent  is  an  interesting  concoction  of  sodium  carbonate, borax, and inactive ingredients (color agents), all of which are very inexpensive, plus  advertising  campaigns,  management  salaries,  distribution  systems,  etc., which  comprise  most  of  the  cost.
商用洗涤剂是碳酸钠、硼砂和非活性成分（着色剂）的有趣混合物，所有这些成分都非常便宜，加上广告宣传、管理人员工资、分销系统等，构成了大部分成本。
To  make  your  own,  you  only  need  sodium carbonate, which is sold as either washing soda (check out the art supply section) or pH booster (next to the pool supplies), borax (laundry detergent section), and grated  bar  soap  (grate  your  own).
要自己制作，你只需要碳酸钠，碳酸钠可以作为洗涤苏打水（查看艺术用品部分）或pH加强剂（泳池用品旁边）、硼砂（洗衣粉部分）和磨碎肥皂（磨碎你自己的）。
Mix  these  in  a  1:1:1  ratio.
按1:1:1的比例混合。
A  load  requires about a tablespoon of this mixture.
一次装载大约需要一汤匙这种混合物。
If you want liquid detergent, simply mix with water  and  heat  up  the  concoction.
如果你想要液体洗涤剂，只需与水混合并加热混合物即可。
Notice  that  the  liquid  version  may  form clumps.
请注意，液体版本可能会形成团块。
This is not a functional problem--just shake the container prior to use.
这不是功能问题——使用前摇动容器即可。

To dry the clothes, use a clothesline.
要晾干衣服，用晾衣绳。
A clothesline is either a piece of string tied between two points or an expensive contraption available at "green living" outlets.
晾衣绳可以是一根绑在两点之间的绳子，也可以是“绿色生活”商店里出售的昂贵玩意儿。
If you stick with the piece of string, the clothesline will be working for you, rather than the other way around.
如果你坚持使用这根绳子，晒衣绳将为你工作，而不是反过来。
Some consider hanging clothes up to be arduous,  backbreaking  labor  involving  about  50  deep  knee  bends  from  the hamper to the line.
有些人认为挂衣服是艰苦的，累人的劳动，把衣服从篮子里拿出挂到线下有50个屈膝动作。
Avoid this (and the hamper) by putting the clothes directly on your shoulder (big items like pants and shirts) or in your hand (small items like socks and underwear).
把衣服直接放在肩膀上（裤子和衬衫之类的大件物品）或手上（袜子和内衣之类的小件物品），以避免这种情况（和篮子）。
Then walk over to the line and transfer them either from the hand or the shoulder as you walk along the line.
顺着线一边走，一边把衣服搭上去或取下来。
There's no reason to bother with pegs unless the wind is blowing strongly.
除非风刮得很大，否则没有理由用夹子。
