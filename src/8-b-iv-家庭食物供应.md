There  are  three  ways  to  supply  your  food  domestically  without  having  to leave  home.
有三种方法可以为家里供应食物，而不必离开家。
The  first  method  is  to  order  in,  either  having  ready-made  food delivered  to  your  door  (expensive)  or  groceries  delivered  (also  expensive,  but maybe not as expensive as a car).
第一种方法是点餐，要么把现成的食物送到门口（很贵），要么把杂货送到门口（也很贵，但可能没有汽车贵）。

The second method is to buy in bulk.
第二种方法是批量购买。
Shop for groceries once a month.
每月购买一次食品杂货。
This will  be  similar  to  provisioning  for  a  cruising  boat,  and  books  on  cruising  will offer  detailed  instructions  for  how  to  do  this,  even  without  the  need  for refrigeration.
这将类似于为游轮提供资源，关于游轮的书籍将提供如何做的详细说明，甚至不需要制冷。
Alternatively, survival literature will provide plans for even longer food storage.
或者，生存文献将提供长时间食物储存的计划。
The benefit of this method is that should something happen, you'll likely have food for a few or even several weeks, depending on your buffer.
这种方法的好处是，如果发生了什么事情，你可能会有上一周甚至几周的食物，这取决于你的缓冲。
If you want this kind of coverage, don't forget to store water.
如果你想要这种覆盖，别忘了储水。
Mark everything with the buy date, eat the oldest first, and keep the store in rotation.
在每样东西上标明购买日期，先吃最老的，并保持存储的轮换。

The third method is growing a majority of your own food.
第三种方法是自己种植大部分食物。
Being completely self-sufficient  is  economically  inefficient.
完全自给自足在经济上是低效的。
It  would  make  economic  sense  to focus  on  crops  that  are  expensive  (tomatoes)  and  buy  crops  that  are  cheap (potatoes).
关注昂贵的作物（西红柿）和购买便宜的作物（土豆）在经济上是合理的。
Combining plants  with animals that  will  eat whatever humans  don't eat  and  provide  fertilizer  that  humans  don't  provide  either  will  cap  the  waste.
将植物与动物结合起来，吃人类不吃的东西，并提供人类不提供的肥料，这将减少浪费。
Unfortunately,  zoning  laws  prohibit  such  farming  in  most  urban  settings.
不幸的是，分区法禁止在大多数城市环境中进行这种耕作。
However,  there's  a  growing  trend  of  urban  farmers that  push  these  laws  to  the limit under a "don't ask, don't tell" policy.
然而，在“不问不说”的政策下，越来越多的城市农民将这些法律推向了极限。
For instance, you could keep (meat) rabbits in your basement, and no, they won't smell if you clean the pens.
例如，你可以把（肉）兔子放在地下室，如果你清洁围栏，它们就不会有气味。
If you can keep animals above ground, have your chicken eat some of the red wiggler worms  you  use  for  speedy  composting  of  your  green  waste.
如果你能把动物养在地上，用红色摇摆虫来快速堆肥绿色垃圾，让鸡吃红色摇摆虫。
If  you  can't  have chicken, at least get a fishing license and use your surplus worms or share them with others.
如果你不能养鸡，至少要拿到捕鱼许可证，用你多余的虫子或者和别人分享。
There are always people who are into vermicomposting.
总有人喜欢蚯蚓堆肥。
All it takes to build a vermicomposter are two buckets and a drill.
建造一个蚯蚓堆肥机只需要两个桶和一个钻头。

If you can't get access to land, and indoor hydroponics is too far-fetched, you could join a CSA (community-supported agriculture).
如果你无法获得土地，而且室内水培太遥远，你可以加入CSA（社区支持农业）。
Buying into a CSA seems rather  expensive,  though,  and  it  may  be  cheaper  to  arrange  your  own "community" by asking friends if you can use some of their unused land to plant something.
不过，购买CSA似乎相当昂贵，通过询问朋友，是否可以使用他们的一些闲置土地种植东西，可能让自己的“社区”更便宜。
Many will be happy to let you pluck their oranges or apples to keep their lawn free of obstacles.
许多人会很乐意让你摘下他们的橘子或苹果，以消除他们的草坪上的障碍物。
Some engage in guerrilla gardening.
有些人从事游击队园艺。

You can find many books describing how to grow your own food, whether it's on a farm, a small homestead or even your balcony.
你可以找到许多书，描述如何种植自己的食物，无论是在农场、小宅基地，甚至是阳台上。
In my opinion, at present price levels, growing your own food isn't going to save you much if any money.
在我看来，在目前的价格水平下，种植自己的食物不会为你节省很多钱。
At future price levels, it most likely will.
在未来的价格水平上，它很可能会。
Furthermore, having insourced some of your own food supply, you'll be more resilient.
此外，在自己购买了一些食物后，你会更有韧性。
Besides, gardening can be a very satisfying pastime as you literally get to eat the fruits of your labor, something which is rarely the case in a "real" job.
此外，园艺可以是一种非常令人满意的消遣，因为你真的可以吃到你的劳动成果，这在“真正的”工作中是很少见的。
