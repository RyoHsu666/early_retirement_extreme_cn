There  are  three  ways  to  supply  your  food  domestically  without  having  to leave  home.

The  first  method  is  to  order  in,  either  having  ready-made  food delivered  to  your  door  (expensive)  or  groceries  delivered  (also  expensive,  but maybe not as expensive as a car).

The second method is to buy in bulk.

Shop for groceries once a month.

This will  be  similar  to  provisioning  for  a  cruising  boat,  and  books  on  cruising  will offer  detailed  instructions  for  how  to  do  this,  even  without  the  need  for refrigeration.

Alternatively, survival literature will provide plans for even longer food storage.

The benefit of this method is that should something happen, you'll likely have food for a few or even several weeks, depending on your buffer.

If you want this kind of coverage, don't forget to store water.

Mark everything with the buy date, eat the oldest first, and keep the store in rotation.

The third method is growing a majority of your own food.

Being completely self-sufficient  is  economically  inefficient.

It  would  make  economic  sense  to focus  on  crops  that  are  expensive  (tomatoes)  and  buy  crops  that  are  cheap (potatoes).

Combining plants  with animals that  will  eat whatever humans  don't eat  and  provide  fertilizer  that  humans  don't  provide  either  will  cap  the  waste.

Unfortunately,  zoning  laws  prohibit  such  farming  in  most  urban  settings.

However,  there's  a  growing  trend  of  urban  farmers that  push  these  laws  to  the limit under a "don't ask, don't tell" policy.

For instance, you could keep (meat) rabbits in your basement, and no, they won't smell if you clean the pens.

If you can keep animals above ground, have your chicken eat some of the red wiggler worms  you  use  for  speedy  composting  of  your  green  waste.

If  you  can't  have chicken, at least get a fishing license and use your surplus worms or share them with others.

There are always people who are into vermicomposting.

All it takes to build a vermicomposter are two buckets and a drill.

If you can't get access to land, and indoor hydroponics is too far-fetched, you could join a CSA (community-supported agriculture).

Buying into a CSA seems rather  expensive,  though,  and  it  may  be  cheaper  to  arrange  your  own "community" by asking friends if you can use some of their unused land to plant something.

Many will be happy to let you pluck their oranges or apples to keep their lawn free of obstacles.

Some engage in guerrilla gardening.

You can find many books describing how to grow your own food, whether it's on a farm, a small homestead or even your balcony.

In my opinion, at present price levels, growing your own food isn't going to save you much if any money.

At future price levels, it most likely will.

Furthermore, having insourced some of your own food supply, you'll be more resilient.

Besides, gardening can be a very satisfying pastime as you literally get to eat the fruits of your labor, something which is rarely the case in a "real" job.
