When I ask people who fix their own cars or motorcycles how they learned where all the bits and parts go, I never get the answer I expect.
当我问那些自己修理汽车或摩托车的人，他们是如何了解所有零部件的去向的，我从来没有得到我期望的答案。
Apparently, they didn't  take  an  evening  class  or  community  college  course.
显然，他们没有上过夜校或社区大学。
They  were  not  even taught by their dad.
他们的父亲甚至也没有教过他们。
Rather they got an engine that didn't work, then just tinkered intelligently with it until it did.
相反，他们有一个不工作的引擎，然后用聪明智慧地修理它，直到它工作。
In fact, it seems that a majority of people taking classes are just looking to get credentials for skills they already possess.
事实上，似乎大多数上课的人只是想获得他们已有技能的证书。

Thus, the biggest barrier to overcome is the perception that you need to be an expert  or  take  classes  in  order  to  be  able  to  make  things.
因此，要克服的最大障碍是一种观念，即你需要成为一名专家或参加课程，才能够制造点东西。
This  is  particularly problematic for white-collar workers with white-collar hobbies, like computing, or no-collar hobbies,  like watching  TV.
对于有白领爱好（如计算机）或无领爱好（如看电视）的白领员工来说，这尤其成问题。
However,  if  you  can  tie  a  bowtie,  you can easily learn to knit--I learned knitting from a web page.
然而，如果你能打领结，你就很容易学会编织——我从一个网页上学会了编织。
If you can print your name, you can learn how to solder--I learned it when I was eight years old--and make electronic gadgets or repair electric gadgets.
如果你能打印出你的名字，你就可以学习如何焊接——我八岁时就学会了——以及制造电子产品或修理电子产品。
Repairing broken electronics is  much  more  difficult,  which  is  a  good  reason  to  avoid  electronic  controls  on most  electromechanical  devices.
修复损坏的电子设备要困难得多，这是避免在大多数机电设备上使用电子控制的一个很好的理由。
If  you  can  draw  a  straight  line  and  follow instructions, you can build your own furniture.
如果你能画一条直线并遵循说明，你就可以建造自己的家具。
If you can put the cap back on a bottle,  you  can  fix  engines  and  mechanical  items,  as  those  are  generally composed of fasteners and parts.
如果你能把瓶盖放回瓶子上，你就可以修理发动机和机械部件，因为它们通常由紧固件和零件组成。
In fact, most things can be created or repaired with a combination of the right tools and parts.66  
事实上，大多数东西都可以通过组合正确的工具和部件来创建或修复。
The  challenge  thus  becomes  one  of  sourcing  tools  and  parts.
因此，挑战就变成了采购工具和零件。
Ease of sourcing is important.
采购的便利性很重要。
You don't want to own anything with proprietary parts! Fortunately, there are plenty of good websites and books--sometimes you have  to  ask  for  the  shop  manuals--which  will  tell  you  exactly  which  tools  and which parts you need to accomplish a given task, down to the catalog number.
你不想拥有任何拥有专有部件的东西！幸运的是，有很多很好的网站和书籍——有时你需要索取车间手册——它们会准确地告诉你完成给定任务所需的工具和零件，目录号就标在下面。
Find these books by reading book reviews online.
在线可以找到这些书。

I  suggest  starting  with  either  simple  repairs  or  simple  construction  projects and  build  a  tool  base  as  needs  develop.
我建议从简单的维修或简单的建设项目开始，根据需要建立一个工具库。
It  may  behoove  you  to  keep  a  list  of receipts and expenses to deduct should you later decide to turn it into a business.
如果你以后决定把它变成一个企业，你可能应该保留一份收据和费用清单，以便扣除。
Buying  a  set  of,  say,  screwdrivers  to  "save"  money  is  rarely  worthwhile.
买一套螺丝刀来“省钱”几乎不值得。
You will end up breaking the ones you use constantly and with a collection of ones you never use.
你最终会打破你经常使用的那些，并收集一些你从未使用过的。
Never buy the set.
千万不要买套装。
Also avoid buying a fully equipped shop-set for the same reasons.
出于同样的原因，也要避免购买设备齐全的商店套装。

I  recommend  getting  quality  tools  (see  The  fixer-upper  or  "holding")  but doing cheap projects using cheap materials in the beginning.
我建议获得高质量的工具（参见[修理]()），但在开始时使用廉价材料进行廉价项目。
Quality has at least two components.
质量至少有两个组成部分。
First, tools are mostly an extension of the tool user.
首先，工具主要是用户的扩展。
It wouldn't make sense to spend more money to get functions that the user can't fully utilize.
花更多的钱来得到用户无法充分使用的功能是没有意义的。
Second,  the  inherent  quality  of  the  tool,  as  categorized  into  three  tiers: basic/economic,  standard,  and  shop/professional.
第二，工具的内在质量，分为三个层次：基本/经济、标准和车间/专业。
These  labels  are  typically  not indicative  of  their  place  of  use.
这些标签通常不表示其使用地点。
Consider,  for  example,  pedal  wrenches,  which are used to removed a pedal from the crank arm of a bicycle.
例如，踏板扳手，用来从自行车的曲柄上移除踏板。
A basic wrench is a short,  stamped  piece  of  hardened  metal  which  is  sold  for  "occasional"  use.
基本扳手是一种短的冲压的硬化金属，为“偶尔”使用销售。
However,  unless  the  pedal  is  new  or  the  threads  are  covered  with  anti-seize,  it will bind and the metal wrench will cut into your hand and most likely you won't be  able  to  remove  the  pedal.
然而，除非踏板是新的，或者螺纹上覆盖有防卡剂，否则它会卡住，金属扳手会划破你的手，很可能你无法拆下踏板。
It  would  be  more  accurate  to  say  that  the  basic wrench is for light-duty use.
更准确地说，基本扳手是轻载荷使用的。
Conversely, the shop wrench is longer, angled for leverage, easy on the hands, and accepts an extension bar (a piece of pipe used for leverage).
相反，车间扳手更长，杠杆角度更大，便于双手操作，并且可以接受延长杆（用于杠杆的管子）。
The shop wrench will take off anything, even if you rarely use it.
即使你很少使用扳手，它也能把任何东西拧下来。
There  is  nothing  more  frustrating  than  an  inadequate  tool.
没有什么比工具不足更令人沮丧的了。
Unfortunately,  it's hard  to  know  in  advance  which  strength  of  tool  is  required.
不幸的是，很难提前知道需要哪种强度的工具。
Never  buy  the biggest  tool  just  to  be  sure.
千万不要为了保险而购买最大的工具。
Specifically,  if  you  already  have  a  light-duty  tool which has proven sufficient so far, don't upgrade it for the sake of upgrading.
具体地说，如果你已经有了一个轻型工具，并且目前为止已经被证明是足够的，那么不要为了升级而升级它。

Making  things  is  a  synthetic/creative  process  which  is  based  on  first mastering  the  technical  skills,  second  on  mastering  the  design  principles  (see Gauging mastery).
制造东西是一个综合性/创造性的过程，首先是基于掌握技术技能，其次是基于掌握设计原则（参见[衡量掌握]()）。
There are two paths to "enlightenment." 
“启蒙”有两条道路。
On the first path one first learns all the technical skills before moving on to the design phase.
在第一条道路上，首先学习所有的技术技能，然后再进入设计阶段。
This can be done by starting out in service and repair before moving on to rebuilds and, finally, builds.
这可以通过先开始服务和维修，然后再进行重建和最终构建来实现。
On the second path one starts out with a building project which usually comes with parts and a plan, and learns the skills on an as-needed basis.
在第二条道路上，一个人从构建一个项目开始，该项目通常包括元件和计划，再根据需要学习技能。
The  former  seems  tailored  to  an  educational/work/small  business  structure;  the latter  seems  more  tailored  to  the  hobbyist.
前者似乎适合教育/工作/小企业结构；后者似乎更适合业余爱好者。
The  money  flow  from  the  former could  quickly  turn  positive.
前者的资金流可能很快转为正数。
The  money  flow  from  the  latter  will  stay  negative for longer, as the aim and required level of mastery for profit in creative design is higher than in service and repair.
后者带来的资金流将在更长时间内保持负值，因为创意设计的目标和盈利要求水平高于服务和维修。

Skills  that  are  likely  worthwhile  include  woodworking,  electric  work (wiring,  soldering,  etching  print  boards),  engine  work,  vehicle  maintenance, cooking,  preserving,  clothes  repair  (mending,  hand  and  machine  sewing),  and house maintenance/handyman work.
可能值得学习的技能包括木工、电气工作（布线、焊接、蚀刻印制板）、发动机工作、车辆维护、烹饪、保存、衣服维修（修补、手工和机器缝纫）以及房屋维护/零工工作。
