When I ask people who fix their own cars or motorcycles how they learned where all the bits and parts go, I never get the answer I expect.

Apparently, they didn't  take  an  evening  class  or  community  college  course.

They  were  not  even taught by their dad.

Rather they got an engine that didn't work, then just tinkered intelligently with it until it did.

In fact, it seems that a majority of people taking classes are just looking to get credentials for skills they already possess.

Thus, the biggest barrier to overcome is the perception that you need to be an expert  or  take  classes  in  order  to  be  able  to  make  things.

This  is  particularly problematic for white-collar workers with white-collar hobbies, like computing, or no-collar hobbies,  like watching  TV.

However,  if  you  can  tie  a  bowtie,  you can easily learn to knit--I learned knitting from a web page.

If you can print your name, you can learn how to solder--I learned it when I was eight years old--and make electronic gadgets or repair electric gadgets.

Repairing broken electronics is  much  more  difficult,  which  is  a  good  reason  to  avoid  electronic  controls  on most  electromechanical  devices.

If  you  can  draw  a  straight  line  and  follow instructions, you can build your own furniture.

If you can put the cap back on a bottle,  you  can  fix  engines  and  mechanical  items,  as  those  are  generally composed of fasteners and parts.

In fact, most things can be created or repaired with a combination of the right tools and parts.

66  The  challenge  thus  becomes  one  of  sourcing  tools  and  parts.

Ease of sourcing is important.

You don't want to own anything with proprietary parts! Fortunately, there are plenty of good websites and books--sometimes you have  to  ask  for  the  shop  manuals--which  will  tell  you  exactly  which  tools  and which parts you need to accomplish a given task, down to the catalog number.

Find these books by reading book reviews online.

I  suggest  starting  with  either  simple  repairs  or  simple  construction  projects and  build  a  tool  base  as  needs  develop.

It  may  behoove  you  to  keep  a  list  of receipts and expenses to deduct should you later decide to turn it into a business.

Buying  a  set  of,  say,  screwdrivers  to  "save"  money  is  rarely  worthwhile.

You will end up breaking the ones you use constantly and with a collection of ones you never use.

Never buy the set.

Also avoid buying a fully equipped shop-set for the same reasons.

I  recommend  getting  quality  tools  (see  The  fixer-upper  or  "holding")  but doing cheap projects using cheap materials in the beginning.

Quality has at least two components.

First, tools are mostly an extension of the tool user.

It wouldn't make sense to spend more money to get functions that the user can't fully utilize.

Second,  the  inherent  quality  of  the  tool,  as  categorized  into  three  tiers: basic/economic,  standard,  and  shop/professional.

These  labels  are  typically  not indicative  of  their  place  of  use.

Consider,  for  example,  pedal  wrenches,  which are used to removed a pedal from the crank arm of a bicycle.

A basic wrench is a short,  stamped  piece  of  hardened  metal  which  is  sold  for  "occasional"  use.

However,  unless  the  pedal  is  new  or  the  threads  are  covered  with  anti-seize,  it will bind and the metal wrench will cut into your hand and most likely you won't be  able  to  remove  the  pedal.

It  would  be  more  accurate  to  say  that  the  basic wrench is for light-duty use.

Conversely, the shop wrench is longer, angled for leverage, easy on the hands, and accepts an extension bar (a piece of pipe used for leverage).

The shop wrench will take off anything, even if you rarely use it.

There  is  nothing  more  frustrating  than  an  inadequate  tool.

Unfortunately,  it's hard  to  know  in  advance  which  strength  of  tool  is  required.

Never  buy  the biggest  tool  just  to  be  sure.

Specifically,  if  you  already  have  a  light-duty  tool which has proven sufficient so far, don't upgrade it for the sake of upgrading.

Making  things  is  a  synthetic/creative  process  which  is  based  on  first mastering  the  technical  skills,  second  on  mastering  the  design  principles  (see Gauging mastery).

There are two paths to "enlightenment.

" On the first path one first learns all the technical skills before moving on to the design phase.

This can be done by starting out in service and repair before moving on to rebuilds and, finally, builds.

On the second path one starts out with a building project which usually comes with parts and a plan, and learns the skills on an as-needed basis.

The  former  seems  tailored  to  an  educational/work/small  business  structure;  the latter  seems  more  tailored  to  the  hobbyist.

The  money  flow  from  the  former could  quickly  turn  positive.

The  money  flow  from  the  latter  will  stay  negative for longer, as the aim and required level of mastery for profit in creative design is higher than in service and repair.

Skills  that  are  likely  worthwhile  include  woodworking,  electric  work (wiring,  soldering,  etching  print  boards),  engine  work,  vehicle  maintenance, cooking,  preserving,  clothes  repair  (mending,  hand  and  machine  sewing),  and house maintenance/handyman work.
