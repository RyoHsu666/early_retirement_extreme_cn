Most salary men are specialized wage  earners  who  earn  money  from  one source  only.
大多数工薪族都是专门的挣死工资的人，他们只从一个来源挣钱。
Often,  they  have  no  control  over  the  source  of  the  money.
通常，他们无法控制资金的来源。
For instance, they can choose between having a full-time job or having no job at all.
例如，他们只能在全职工作和完全没有工作间做选择。
This scarcity creates competition for full-time jobs (see Job Competition) rather than a continuous and less competitive distribution of effort between all wage earners.
这种稀缺性造成了全职工作的竞争（参见[职业竞争]()），而不是所有工薪阶层之间持续且较低的竞争性。
The  jobs  which  specialists  are  typically  hired  for  comprise  a  fairly narrow  set  of  tasks.
聘请专家的工作通常是一组相当狭窄的任务。
Their  job  is  to  use  certain  resources  and  turn  them  into certain parts of a final product.
他们的工作是使用某些资源并将其转化为最终产品的某些部分。
Thus, salary men have little control beyond their well-defined job descriptions.
因此，除了明确的工作描述之外，领薪人几乎没有什么控制权。

Salary men have options, but they do not create options.
领薪人有选择，但他们不创造选择。
This linearization makes them predictable and subject to indirect control.
这种线性化使其可预测，并受到间接控制。
This control is exerted by providing  a  choice  within  a  narrow  range.
这种控制是通过在狭窄的范围内提供选择来实现的。
"You  can  choose  between  the  following three models of cookie-cutter homes.
“您可以在以下三种型号的曲奇饼房屋中进行选择。
You shouldn't modify them or your resale value will be impaired.
您不可以修改它们，否则您的转售价值将受到损害。”
" "You can choose to drive a car subject to various  rules  and  regulations.
“你可以根据在各种规章制度控制下选择开车。”
"  "You  can  choose  between  the  following  two political candidates. You shouldn't vote for others, or your vote will be wasted.
“你可以在以下两位政治候选人中选择。你不应该投票给别人，否则你的票就浪费了。”
" "You  can  choose  between  the  following  25  different,  heavily  advertised breakfast cereals, but don't think of starting your day with anything but breakfast cereal.
“你可以在下面25种不同的、广告宣传很广的早餐麦片中选择，但不要想着一天的开始就吃早餐麦片以外的任何东西。”
" "Choose the size and type of your TV and the number of channels, but don't consider not watching TV, or you might miss out.
“可以选择你的电视的大小、类型和频道数量，但不能考虑不看电视，否则你可能会错过一些东西。”
" This gives the illusion of freedom while retaining control.
这在保持控制的同时给人以自由的错觉。

With both work and consumption being well-controlled, the salary man may be thought of as a brick in a wall or a cog in a machine.
由于工作和消费都得被很好的控制，领薪人可能被认为是墙上的砖头或机器上的齿轮。
The associated cash flows are relatively simple.
相关现金流相对简单。
In the simplest case, time and energy flows from the specialist into a wage-earning job.
在最简单的情况下，时间和精力从专家流向赚取工资的工作。
Money from the job, in turn, covers 100% of expenses.
反过来，从工作中获得的钱支付了100%的花销。
Thus, the professional puts time and energy into his work that pays him  a  wage  income,  which  is  used  to  pay  for  stuff  that  he  subsequently consumes.
也就是，专业人士将时间和精力投入到工作中，从而获得工资收入，用于支付他随后消费的东西。
Wages are typically preset to be "economic," meaning that there is no profit nor loss in it for the professional.
工资通常被预设为“经济的”，这意味着专业人士既没有利润也没有损失。
The "profit/loss" in this setup goes to the owner of the machine that the cog fits into.
此设置中的“利润/损失”归齿轮依附的机器所有者所有。
It's obvious that the professional in this case is tightly coupled to his job.
很明显，本案例中的专业人员与其工作紧密相连。
Many people's budgets are tightly coupled, since they've been encouraged to spend everything they earn.
许多人的预算是紧密耦合的，因为他们被鼓励花掉所有挣来的钱。
Why work if you can't spend your paycheck? After all, you deserve it.
如果你不能花你的薪水，为什么还要工作？毕竟，这是你应得的。
You earned it.
你赚的。
In fact, many financial  planners  implicitly  assume  "expenses=income"  in  their  calculations.
事实上，许多理财规划师在计算中都隐含着“费用=收入”的假设。
Therefore, any decrease in income is felt instantly.
因此，收入的任何减少都会立即感受到。
An industrial example of a tightly coupled linear system is a manufacturing plant.
紧密耦合线性系统的一个工业示例是制造厂。
If any part of the system runs  slow,  the  entire  plant  runs  slow  and  output  decreases.
如果系统的任何部分运行缓慢，则整个工厂运行缓慢，产量降低。
The  incentive  is therefore to make sure that all parts are equally fast or equally slow and work together as a team.
因此，激励因素是确保所有部件都同样快或同样慢，并作为一个团队一起工作。

Most  consumer  products  are  also  engineered  as  tightly  coupled  linear products.
大多数消费品也被设计成紧密耦合的线性产品。
For those products, it's optimal if all parts have about the same rate of failure.
对于这些产品，如果所有部件的故障率都差不多，那么这是最佳选择。
If one component lasts a lot longer and the product isn't designed to be repaired, that component is deemed to be overengineered and it will be replaced by  a  cheaper  component  which  would  create  more  profit.
如果一个部件使用时间较长，且产品设计不适合维修，则该部件被视为过度工程，将被更便宜的部件替代，从而创造更多利润。
Thus,  if  a  product hasn't  been  designed  to  be  repaired  (most  consumer  products),  one  will experience the curious phenomenon that once one part fails and is repaired, other parts  will  start  failing  soon  after.
因此，如果一个产品（大多数消费品）没有被设计便于维修，人们会体验到一种奇怪的现象，即一旦一个部件出现故障并被维修，其他部件不久就会开始出现故障。
It  wouldn't  be  an  exaggeration  to  state  that many consumers' budgets work in a similar manner.
可以毫不夸张地说，许多消费者的预算也是以类似的方式运作的。

The  example  above  demonstrates  the  typical  cash  flow of  people  without credit.
上面的例子展示了没有信贷的人的典型现金流。
People with access to credit can go into debt, and they usually do.
能够获得信贷的人可能会负债，而且他们通常会这样做。
In this case, debt can be used to pay for more stuff and wages can be used to pay for  debt, such as from credit cards, car loans, mortgages, student loans, etc.
在这种情况下，债务可以用来支付更多的东西，工资可以用来支付债务，如信用卡、汽车贷款、抵押贷款、学生贷款等。
This allows people to buy more than they can presently afford in exchange for less income in the future.
这使得人们可以购买超出他们目前负担能力的商品，以换取未来收入的减少。

Few  people  pay  cash  anymore  and  "financial  success"  depends  on  being good at managing debt.
很少有人再付现金了，“财务上的成功”取决于善于管理债务。
As an ironic twist, like grade point averages in school, debt  management  skills  are  also  evaluated  in  a  single  number  called  a  credit score.
具有讽刺意味的是，就像学校的平均分数一样，债务管理技能也用一个称为信用分数的数字进行评估。
It's not clear exactly how a credit score is computed, and therefore much time  is  spent  trying  to  outguess  the  system.
目前还不清楚信用评分是如何计算的，因此需要花费大量的时间来猜测系统。
Personal  finance,  as  opposed  to business finance, operates on the concept of consumption smoothing also known as, "Fake it until you make it," as it allows consumers to buy products which they presently can't afford due to lack of savings, but will be able to afford by making  payments  over  time.
与商业金融相反，个人金融是基于消费平滑的概念运作的，也被称为“在你成功之前伪造它”，因为它允许消费者购买目前由于缺乏储蓄而买不起的产品，但随着时间的推移，他们可以支付得起。
Unlike  a  business,  which  invests  the  money  in assets  with  a  higher  return,  allowing  businesses  to  use  debt  as  a  leverage, consumers "invest" in higher consumption.
与将资金投资于回报率较高的资产、允许企业利用债务作为杠杆的企业不同，消费者“投资”于更高的消费。
The lack of return on assets to pay the interest means they must either work harder or longer for their consumption, and  so  they  do.
资产回报率不足，无法支付利息，这意味着他们必须更加努力地工作，他们也确实如此。
Add  lifestyle inflation  (see  The  pursuit  of  stuff,  status,  and happiness) and you have a process that inherently demands more and more work while quite possibly providing less and less contentment.
再加上生活方式的膨胀（参见[对物质、地位和幸福的追求]()），你就有了一个内在要求越来越多工作的过程，同时很可能提供越来越少的满足感。
This is the definition of a wage slave.
这是薪资奴隶的定义。
Wage slaves are free to change their job, but they're not free to quit their  job.
薪资奴隶可以自由地换工作，但他们不能自由地辞职。
Wage  slaves  are  free  to  choose  other  products  as  long  as  they  can afford  it,  but  they're  not  capable  of  creating  alternatives  to  buying  products, because they're too busy working.
薪资奴隶可以自由选择其他产品，只要他们负担得起，但他们没有能力创造购买品的替代品，因为他们太忙了。
