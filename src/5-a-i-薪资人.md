Most salary men are specialized wage  earners  who  earn  money  from  one source  only.

Often,  they  have  no  control  over  the  source  of  the  money.

For instance, they can choose between having a full-time job or having no job at all.

This scarcity creates competition for full-time jobs (see Job Competition) rather than a continuous and less competitive distribution of effort between all wage earners.

The  jobs  which  specialists  are  typically  hired  for  comprise  a  fairly narrow  set  of  tasks.

Their  job  is  to  use  certain  resources  and  turn  them  into certain parts of a final product.

Thus, salary men have little control beyond their well-defined job descriptions.

Salary men have options, but they do not create options.

This linearization makes them predictable and subject to indirect control.

This control is exerted by providing  a  choice  within  a  narrow  range.

"You  can  choose  between  the  following three models of cookie-cutter homes.

You shouldn't modify them or your resale value will be impaired.

" "You can choose to drive a car subject to various  rules  and  regulations.

"  "You  can  choose  between  the  following  two political candidates.

You shouldn't vote for others, or your vote will be wasted.

" "You  can  choose  between  the  following  25  different,  heavily  advertised breakfast cereals, but don't think of starting your day with anything but breakfast cereal.

" "Choose the size and type of your TV and the number of channels, but don't consider not watching TV, or you might miss out.

" This gives the illusion of freedom while retaining control.

With both work and consumption being well-controlled, the salary man may be thought of as a brick in a wall or a cog in a machine.

The associated cash flows are relatively simple.

In the simplest case, time and energy flows from the specialist into a wage-earning job.

Money from the job, in turn, covers 100% of expenses.

Thus, the professional puts time and energy into his work that pays him  a  wage  income,  which  is  used  to  pay  for  stuff  that  he  subsequently consumes.

Wages are typically preset to be "economic," meaning that there is no profit nor loss in it for the professional.

The "profit/loss" in this setup goes to the owner of the machine that the cog fits into.

It's obvious that the professional in this case is tightly coupled to his job.

Many people's budgets are tightly coupled, since they've been encouraged to spend everything they earn.

Why work if you can't spend your paycheck? After all, you deserve it.

You earned it.

In fact, many financial  planners  implicitly  assume  "expenses=income"  in  their  calculations.

Therefore, any decrease in income is felt instantly.

An industrial example of a tightly coupled linear system is a manufacturing plant.

If any part of the system runs  slow,  the  entire  plant  runs  slow  and  output  decreases.

The  incentive  is therefore to make sure that all parts are equally fast or equally slow and work together as a team.

Most  consumer  products  are  also  engineered  as  tightly  coupled  linear products.

For those products, it's optimal if all parts have about the same rate of failure.

If one component lasts a lot longer and the product isn't designed to be repaired, that component is deemed to be overengineered and it will be replaced by  a  cheaper  component  which  would  create  more  profit.

Thus,  if  a  product hasn't  been  designed  to  be  repaired  (most  consumer  products),  one  will experience the curious phenomenon that once one part fails and is repaired, other parts  will  start  failing  soon  after.

It  wouldn't  be  an  exaggeration  to  state  that many consumers' budgets work in a similar manner.

The  example  above  demonstrates  the  typical  cash  flow of  people  without credit.

People with access to credit can go into debt, and they usually do.

In this case, debt can be used to pay for more stuff and wages can be used to pay for  debt, such as from credit cards, car loans, mortgages, student loans, etc.

This allows people to buy more than they can presently afford in exchange for less income in the future.

Few  people  pay  cash  anymore  and  "financial  success"  depends  on  being good at managing debt.

As an ironic twist, like grade point averages in school, debt  management  skills  are  also  evaluated  in  a  single  number  called  a  credit score.

It's not clear exactly how a credit score is computed, and therefore much time  is  spent  trying  to  outguess  the  system.

Personal  finance,  as  opposed  to business finance, operates on the concept of consumption smoothing also known as, "Fake it until you make it," as it allows consumers to buy products which they presently can't afford due to lack of savings, but will be able to afford by making  payments  over  time.

Unlike  a  business,  which  invests  the  money  in assets  with  a  higher  return,  allowing  businesses  to  use  debt  as  a  leverage, consumers "invest" in higher consumption.

The lack of return on assets to pay the interest means they must either work harder or longer for their consumption, and  so  they  do.

Add  lifestyle inflation  (see  The  pursuit  of  stuff,  status,  and happiness) and you have a process that inherently demands more and more work while quite possibly providing less and less contentment.

This is the definition of a wage slave.

Wage slaves are free to change their job, but they're not free to quit their  job.

Wage  slaves  are  free  to  choose  other  products  as  long  as  they  can afford  it,  but  they're  not  capable  of  creating  alternatives  to  buying  products, because they're too busy working.
