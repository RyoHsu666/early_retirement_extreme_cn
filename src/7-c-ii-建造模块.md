The world is like a box of Legos. 

世界就像一盒乐高。

A box of Legos comes with blocks and
instructions to build a particular model or product out of the blocks, specifically
blocks + instructions = model.

一盒乐高包含了积木和如何建造指定模块或生产其他积木的说明，即

积木 + 说明 = 模块。


However, the world is normally not perceived as a box of Legos. 

然而，这个世界正常不会让人感觉到是一盒乐高。

Mostly, the
accompanying instructions are followed slavishly and the fact that the blocks can
be combined creatively into new models is forgotten. 

大多数情况下，伴随而来的是奴役般的指示，并且积木可以被创造性组建成新的模块已经被遗忘了。

This turns the box into a
kit model.

这把盒子变成了一个模块。

 Mentally, this reduces the concept of a building block from something
that can be creatively combined in many different ways to being merely "part
27a" which is to be fitted with "part 27b" in step "8."

精神上，这减少了在多种渠道上创造性组建积木的概念，使之几乎成了在步骤“8”，“27a 部分”固定到“27b部分”上。

Even worse, much of the world comes preassembled.

更糟糕的是，大多数的世界是预先组装好的。

 With the blocks thus
gone, this reduces the equation to

随着积木的消失，公式简化成了

instructions = model.

指示 = 模块。


Often the instructions are reduced and simplified under the mantra of being
easier  to  use.  This  reduces  not  only  the  creativity  of  the  user  but  also  the
operating skills, which are transferred into the model or product. The product
turns from being low-tech but high-concept to being high-tech but low-concept.
The beauty of this from a business perspective is that each model can be
turned into a profitable product and sold separately. This is the reason that we
now have electric rice cookers, egg cookers, bread-makers, toasters, hamburger
cookers, etc. and as a consequence people have forgotten how to fry an egg in a
pan,46 amongst other things. Hence, the equation has been reduced to
product = model,
where the only instruction people need to know is "Get into your car and
drive down to a shop and buy the product. Then go to work and make money to
pay for it."
At this level of incompetence, success can only come from buying a product.
More products, more success. This is expensive and wasteful. Just think of how
many  times  a  pan  and  a  heating  element  are  replicated  in  the  appliances
mentioned above, not to mention that electricity is a really inappropriate source
of heat.
To  avoid  this  waste,  we  must  relearn  how  to  fry  an  egg,  specifically  by
realizing that frying an egg first and foremost requires a surface that transfers
heat and a source of heat, and not necessarily the "Wonderfryer 3000." In more
general  terms,  we  must  once  again  perceive  the  building  blocks  to  construct
more economical solutions. This doesn't mean that you literally have to go and
take your appliances apart. Rather, it means considering what kind of utility a
product provides and what kind of need or want you have, and then think of
other more economical means of solving a specific problem by using a different
way of putting the blocks together.
Focusing on utility rather than consumer products or instructions is a key
tactic.  Success  is  then  redefined  from  accumulating  and  consuming  the
maximum number of products or the most expensive products to deriving the
maximum utility.
Having been raised on products, a key challenge for recovering consumers is
to  identify  their  actual  core  needs  and  wants.  The  reason  that  this  can  be
challenging is that consumers are used to associating needs with products. For
instance,  it's  hard  to  disassociate  being  free  from  headaches  from  taking
headache  pills  or  to  disassociate  losing  weight  from  buying  the  "FatMaster
3000." Or to pick a simpler example: Imagine a dog needing to get onto a couch.
The utility sought is the dog ending up on the couch, and there are many ways to
achieve this before buying a dog ramp. If the dog can't jump or be lifted by a
human, the dog needs something to step on. That's the utility sought: something

to step on, not necessarily a dog ramp. Consider the ubiquitous box. A box can
be used for storage. It can also be used to sit on or support other objects (aha!-
moment47) or block a passage. Ideally, a box could be used for many things at
once,  so  that  it  takes  up  little  space  relative  to  its  usefulness.  For  example,
several storage boxes could be combined into a dog ramp (aha!). After being
decommissioned, it could be cut up for firewood, unless it is made out of plastic,
and its construction is simple, so you can make it yourself. Failing that, finding
box-shaped containers is trivial.
A box, particularly a sturdy wooden box, has wide utility and would thus fit
well into the web of goals way of thinking which was outlined in Contingency
goal-setting. Most important, though, is that its wide utility exists mainly as a
potential in your mind. A person with no imagination and few skills will only see
the box as a container. Approach the world without prejudice, start seeing things
for  what  they  are  and  what  they  can  be  used  for,  not  what  you've  been  told
they're intended for. To do this requires seeing utility from a fresh perspective.
This  is  also  called  lateral  thinking,  a  kind  of  thinking  that  improves  with
generalization  and  worsens  with  specialization,  or  out-of-the-box  thinking,
which really originates from having thought in many different kinds of boxes. In
particular, it requires a shift in focus from products to components.
