The world is like a box of Legos. 

世界就像一盒乐高。

A box of Legos comes with blocks and
instructions to build a particular model or product out of the blocks, specifically
blocks + instructions = model.

一盒乐高包含了积木和如何建造指定模块或生产其他积木的说明，即

积木 + 说明 = 模块。


However, the world is normally not perceived as a box of Legos. 

然而，这个世界正常不会让人感觉到是一盒乐高。

Mostly, the
accompanying instructions are followed slavishly and the fact that the blocks can
be combined creatively into new models is forgotten. 

大多数情况下，伴随而来的是奴役般的指示，并且积木可以被创造性组建成新的模块的事实已经被遗忘了。

This turns the box into a
kit model.

这把盒子变成了一个模块。

 Mentally, this reduces the concept of a building block from something
that can be creatively combined in many different ways to being merely "part
27a" which is to be fitted with "part 27b" in step "8."

精神上，这减少了在多种渠道上创造性组建积木的概念，使之几乎成了在步骤“8”，把“27a 部分”固定到“27b部分”上。

Even worse, much of the world comes preassembled.

更糟糕的是，大多数的世界是预先组装好的。

 With the blocks thus
gone, this reduces the equation to

随着积木的消失，公式简化成了

instructions = model.

指示 = 模块。


Often the instructions are reduced and simplified under the mantra of being
easier  to  use.  

在用起来更简单的魔咒下，指示经常被简化。

This  reduces  not  only  the  creativity  of  the  user  but  also  the
operating skills, which are transferred into the model or product. 

这不仅减少了用户的创造力，也减少了操作技巧，这些被转化成了模块或产品，

The product
turns from being low-tech but high-concept to being high-tech but low-concept.

产品从低技术高概念转化成了高技术但是低概念。


The beauty of this from a business perspective is that each model can be
turned into a profitable product and sold separately. 

从商业的视角来看，这样的美丽之处在于，每个模块都可以转换成合适的产品，并能单独卖出。

This is the reason that we
now have electric rice cookers, egg cookers, bread-makers, toasters, hamburger
cookers, etc. 

这就是为什么我们现在有电饭煲，煮蛋器，面包机，吐司机，汉堡机等等。

and as a consequence people have forgotten how to fry an egg in a
pan,46 amongst other things.

随着人们渐渐忘了如何用锅煎鸡蛋和其他一些事情。

 Hence, the equation has been reduced to

然后，公式就简化成了：

product = model,

产品 = 模块，

where the only instruction people need to know is "Get into your car and
drive down to a shop and buy the product. Then go to work and make money to
pay for it."

这样人们需要的指示只有一个“上车，开到商场，买东西。然后工作，付账单。”


At this level of incompetence, success can only come from buying a product.

在这种比较层级中，成功只能来自买东西。

More products, more success.

越多的东西，越成功。

 This is expensive and wasteful. Just think of how
many  times  a  pan  and  a  heating  element  are  replicated  in  the  appliances
mentioned above, not to mention that electricity is a really inappropriate source
of heat.

这是昂贵和浪费的。想想一个煎锅和一个加热设备可以替代上面的设备，更不用想这些设备是不适合的热源。

To  avoid  this  waste,  we  must  relearn  how  to  fry  an  egg,  specifically  by
realizing that frying an egg first and foremost requires a surface that transfers
heat and a source of heat, and not necessarily the "Wonderfryer 3000." 

为了避免浪费，我们必须学习如何煎蛋，这需要一个热量传输的平面和一个热源，不需要“精彩煎炸3000例”。

In more
general  terms,  we  must  once  again  perceive  the  building  blocks  to  construct
more economical solutions. 

从更通用的角度讲，我们必须再一次建造更能经济的解决方案的积木。

This doesn't mean that you literally have to go and
take your appliances apart. 

这不意味着你需要从零开始建造你的工具块。

Rather, it means considering what kind of utility a
product provides and what kind of need or want you have, and then think of
other more economical means of solving a specific problem by using a different
way of putting the blocks together.

而是，这意味着什么样的产品提供什么样的功能，你需要什么和你想要什么，然后思考，通过把积木拼到一起，得到其他更经济的解决方案。

Focusing on utility rather than consumer products or instructions is a key
tactic. 

关注功能而不是消费产品或者指示是关键的战术。

 Success  is  then  redefined  from  accumulating  and  consuming  the
maximum number of products or the most expensive products to deriving the
maximum utility.

成功就从积累和消耗最多产品或最昂贵的产品重定义成了获取最大的功效。

Having been raised on products, a key challenge for recovering consumers is
to  identify  their  actual  core  needs  and  wants. 

因为已经被产品抬高，关键的挑战是让消费者重新定位他们核心的需求和欲望。

 The  reason  that  this  can  be
challenging is that consumers are used to associating needs with products.

原因是消费者过去一直依赖产品生活。

 For
instance,  it's  hard  to  disassociate  being  free  from  headaches  from  taking
headache  pills  or  to  disassociate  losing  weight  from  buying  the  "FatMaster
3000." Or to pick a simpler example: Imagine a dog needing to get onto a couch.

例如，很难让头疼的人和去痛片解除关系，或者减肥和“肥肉克星3000”解除关系，或者下面的简单例子：相像让狗上沙发。

The utility sought is the dog ending up on the couch, and there are many ways to
achieve this before buying a dog ramp. 

要寻找一个不让狗再上沙发的装置，其实在买狗坡道之前有很多解决途径。

If the dog can't jump or be lifted by a
human, the dog needs something to step on. 

如果狗不能跳或者不被人举起来，那狗需要一些台阶。

That's the utility sought: something

to step on, not necessarily a dog ramp. 

这就是需要的装置：一个台阶，不用狗坡道。

Consider the ubiquitous box. A box can
be used for storage. It can also be used to sit on or support other objects (aha!-
moment47) or block a passage.

考虑一下常见的箱子。箱子能用来装东西。它也能用来坐或者支撑其他东西（啊哈！时刻）或者挡住过道。

 Ideally, a box could be used for many things at
once,  so  that  it  takes  up  little  space  relative  to  its  usefulness. 

理想中，箱子可以一次用作多种事情，和它的实用性比它只占用了一点空间。

 For  example,
several storage boxes could be combined into a dog ramp (aha!). 

例如，多个储物箱能组合成狗坡（啊哈！）。

After being
decommissioned, it could be cut up for firewood, unless it is made out of plastic,
and its construction is simple, so you can make it yourself.

用坏了以后，如果不是塑料的，它能砍碎成柴火，箱子造起来也很简单，你可以自己做。

 Failing that, finding
box-shaped containers is trivial.
A box, particularly a sturdy wooden box, has wide utility and would thus fit
well into the web of goals way of thinking which was outlined in Contingency
goal-setting. 

如果这失败了，找些箱子形状的容器也是简单的。一个箱子，特别是坚固的木头箱子，有广泛的用途，考虑一下持续目标设定章节，箱子能适应一系列的目标网。

Most important, though, is that its wide utility exists mainly as a
potential in your mind. 

更重要的，思考一下，你头脑中有没有广泛适应性的物件。

A person with no imagination and few skills will only see
the box as a container. 

一个没有想象力和缺乏技能的人只会把箱子想象成容器。

Approach the world without prejudice, start seeing things
for  what  they  are  and  what  they  can  be  used  for,  not  what  you've  been  told
they're intended for. 

没有预判地探索世界，开始看出事物是什么和能用来做什么，而不是别人告诉你它们能做什么。

To do this requires seeing utility from a fresh perspective.

做到这一点需要一个看事物的全新视角。

This  is  also  called  lateral  thinking,  a  kind  of  thinking  that  improves  with
generalization  and  worsens  with  specialization,  or  out-of-the-box  thinking,
which really originates from having thought in many different kinds of boxes.

这也被叫做横向思维，一直提供通用思考方式，或者跳出盒子来的思考方式，这种思维方式真的是起源于思考不同类型的盒子来的。

 In
particular, it requires a shift in focus from products to components.

特别的，这需要从关注产品到关注组件的转变。
