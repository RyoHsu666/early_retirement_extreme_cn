Generally,  renting  is  an  overused  method  when  it  doesn't  benefit  the consumer,  and  an  underused  method  when  it  would  benefit  the  consumer.

Consequently, if you're used to buying something, you should look into how and where  to  rent.

Conversely,  if  you're  used  to  renting,  calculate  whether  it's worthwhile.

When renting long-term, consider the cap rate (see Rent or own?), which holds for small items as well as houses.

When renting, you're usually not responsible for breakdowns.

This is a winning proposition if you don't have the skills  to  fix  it  yourself  and  a  losing  one  if  you  do  have  the  skills  or  could cultivate  them.

Also  important  is  how  often  you  use  a  thing.

Maybe  a  24  foot ladder  is  only  used  once  a  year,  in  which  case  it  could  be  rented  from  a  home improvement store.

If you do a lot of printing, it makes sense to own your own printer,  but  it  actually  takes  a  lot  of  $0.

50  printouts  at  the  local  copy  center before the price of a new printer is reached.

Also, consider that instead of renting very  expensive  and  rarely  used  special  tools,  you  could  simply  hire  a professional and his tools to do that part of the job.
