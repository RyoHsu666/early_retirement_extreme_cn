I submit that we currently live in a climax stage.21 
我认为我们目前生活在一个高潮阶段。21
We have a political model that is based on leading in the popular polls--a model where barely differentiated political leaders pretend to be different by steering voters away from important issues and onto subjects that, albeit emotional, are of little consequence to most people--a  model  where  the  election  is  won  by  the  person  with  the  best marketing, and where consistency and integrity are irrelevant. 
我们有一个基于民意调查领先的政治模式，一个几乎没有区别的政治领导人，通过引导选民远离重要问题，而转向情绪化的话题，来装作有所不同的模式，这对大多数人来说都没有什么影响——这是一种由最会市场营销的人赢得选举的模式，而一致性和诚信是无关紧要的。
We have an economic model that is based on pulling resources out of the ground and mostly turning them into unnecessary products, getting people to buy the products by convincing them that they need them, then getting them to throw the  products  away  because  they're  obsolete. 
我们有一种经济模式，它的基础是将资源从地下抽出来，大部分将其转化为不必要的产品，通过说服人们需要这些产品，来让人们购买这些产品，然后让他们因为产品过时而扔掉这些产品。
This  makes  people  buy  the  next model and bury the other one in the ground. 
这使得人们买下一个，然后把另一个埋在地下。
The sole goal of this seemingly pointless exercise is to work faster and grow the gross domestic product, which measures the resource churn. 
这一看似毫无意义的行动的唯一目标是加快工作速度，增加国内生产总值——它衡量了资源的流失。
We live in a world where the money necessary for our way of life comes out of a slit in the wall as long as we keep showing up for work, yet only experts understand the fiat-based money/credit system. 
我们生活在这样一个世界里，只要我们继续上班，维持我们的生活方式所需的资金就会从墙缝中流出，但只有专家了解基于法定货币/信用体系。
We live in a world where food can be heated in a microwave oven at the touch of a button, yet only experts understand how this works. 
我们生活在一个只需按一下按钮，就可以在微波炉中加热食物的世界里，但只有专家知道这是如何工作的。
This goes for most of the other technology we use. 
这适用于我们使用的大多数其他技术。
All we know is that if we press this or that button, things magically happen. 
我们所知道的是，只要我们按下这个或那个按钮，神奇的事情就会发生。
We are aware of large-scale problems, but most of us believe that we can't do anything about them. 
我们意识到大规模的问题，但我们大多数人认为我们对此无能为力。
Instead, we believe in a mythical They who will find a solution, just like They have provided all this wonderful technology we surround ourselves with. 
相反，我们相信一个神话，他们会找到解决方案，就像他们提供了我们周围的所有精彩技术一样。
We  may  be  more  technologically  advanced  as  a  group,  and  correctly  but myopically hold up technology as our one indicator of "progress,"22 but in terms of individual understanding we have not come far, and once again live according to old concepts. 
作为一个群体，我们可能在技术上更加先进，并且正确但目光短浅地将技术视为我们“进步”的一个指标，但就个人理解而言，我们还没有走得很远，并且再次按照旧观念生活。
In fact, we might have turned a full cycle from the last climax stage: The Dark Ages
事实上，我们可能已经转了一个圈回到了最近的一个高潮阶段：黑暗时代。
