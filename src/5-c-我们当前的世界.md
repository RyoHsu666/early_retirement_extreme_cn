I submit that we currently live in a climax stage.21 We have a political model
that is based on leading in the popular polls--a model where barely differentiated
political leaders pretend to be different by steering voters away from important
issues and onto subjects that, albeit emotional, are of little consequence to most
people--a  model  where  the  election  is  won  by  the  person  with  the  best
marketing, and where consistency and integrity are irrelevant.
We have an economic model that is based on pulling resources out of the
ground and mostly turning them into unnecessary products, getting people to buy
the products by convincing them that they need them, then getting them to throw
the  products  away  because  they're  obsolete.  This  makes  people  buy  the  next
model and bury the other one in the ground. The sole goal of this seemingly
pointless exercise is to work faster and grow the gross domestic product, which
measures the resource churn.
We live in a world where the money necessary for our way of life comes out
of a slit in the wall as long as we keep showing up for work, yet only experts
understand the fiat-based money/credit system. We live in a world where food
can be heated in a microwave oven at the touch of a button, yet only experts
understand how this works. This goes for most of the other technology we use.
All we know is that if we press this or that button, things magically happen.
We are aware of large-scale problems, but most of us believe that we can't do
anything about them. Instead, we believe in a mythical They who will find a
solution, just like They have provided all this wonderful technology we surround
ourselves with.
We  may  be  more  technologically  advanced  as  a  group,  and  correctly  but
myopically hold up technology as our one indicator of "progress,"22 but in terms
of individual understanding we have not come far, and once again live according
to old concepts. In fact, we might have turned a full cycle from the last climax
stage: The Dark Ages
