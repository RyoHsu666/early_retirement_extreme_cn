In  general,  people  who  live  a  life  of  abundance,  like  "primitive"  tribesmen (see Human capital and necessary personal assets) or Californians, will be happy to  give  things  away,  the  latter  primarily  to  create  more  space  in  their  garages, and  the  former  presumably  because  they  can  easily  build  replacements.

Dumpster  diving  is  one  method  of  acquiring  free  things,  but  with  the  Internet, the  dumpster  part  is  skipped.

Post  wanted  or  offered  ads  on  mailing  lists, newsgroups, or in classifieds, and people respond and come to pick it up.

This saves the trouble of putting stuff in a dumpster and people from having to dive in to get it; it also saves stuff from the landfill.

The range of stuff changing hands can  be  surprising:  from  leaves  for  composting  to  projector  TVs.

Supply  and demand also fluctuates.

What may be impossible to give away one month may be in high demand the next month.

What may be impossible to give away in one place--entertainment  centers  in  California--may  be  picked  up  in  another  within the  hour;  possibly  to  be  used  as  firewood.

Speaking  of  firewood,  people  are happy to give away rounds in the summer when they're clearing away old trees to  increase  the  size  of  their  lawns.

Get  a  splitting  maul  and  dry  them  for firewood in the winter.

All it requires is a little planning and your heating is free.

For  lower-cost  items  which  are  not  worth  driving  for,  get  rid  of  them  by establishing  a  "table.

"  Put  things  on  the  table  and  mark  them  "FREE.

"  Lo  and behold, people will quickly pick up on the idea, take your items away, and put other items down.

This works for magazines, garden harvest, cookies, etc.

and is nicely  established  near  the  coffee  machine,  laundry  facility,  stairway,  or  other points where people gather or pass.
