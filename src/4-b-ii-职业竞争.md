As  mentioned  above,  specialization  has  another  problem. 
如上所述，专业化还有另一个问题。

 Competition  is very difficult because it's hard to compare the actual skills of the specialists. 
竞争非常激烈，因为很难比较专家的实际技能。

In some  cases,  the  desired  skill  level  for  a  position  is  reached  by  several competitors, who are all sufficiently good. 
在某些情况下，几个竞争者都达到了，一个职位所需的技能水平，他们都足够优秀。

If there are plenty of competitors, the decision process breaks down, becomes fuzzy, and starts depending on things that are less connected with the skills in demand. 
如果有很多竞争对手，决策过程就会崩溃，变得模糊，并开始依赖于与所需技能联系较少的事情。

In those cases, getting the job begins  to  depend  on  intangibles  which  are  generally  outside  the  control,  and certainly outside the specialization, of the worker. 
在这些情况下，获得工作开始依赖于无形资产，这些无形资产通常不受外界控制，当然也不受外界专业化影响。

Of course, there are plenty other specialists who will sell advice on what to wear, how to format a résumé, which clubs to join, etc. 
当然，还有很多其他专家会就穿什么、如何格式化简历、加入哪些俱乐部等提供建议。

This is good for the system, but less beneficial for the individual.
Large amounts of time are spent picking the few winners of this game. 
这对系统有利，但对个人不利。
大量时间用于挑选这场比赛的少数获胜者。

One might argue that the function of a college education isn't so much to provide education as it is to produce college dropouts, who are willing to accept lower paying jobs. 
有人可能会争辩说，大学教育的功能与其说是提供教育，不如说是培养愿意接受低薪工作的大学辍学生。

In other words, a college education is a sorting mechanism. 
换句话说，大学教育是一种分类机制。

It does not stop there, though. 
然而，它并不止于此。

A so-called career provides a similar sorting mechanism.
People frequently talk about climbing the corporate ladder. 
所谓的职业提供了类似的排序机制。
人们经常谈论攀登公司阶梯。

However, a ladder implies that if one climbs hard enough, one eventually will get to the top. 
然而，梯子意味着如果一个人爬得足够努力，最终会到达顶部。

In reality, it's more like a corporate pyramid. 
实际上，它更像是一个企业金字塔。

Not only does one have to climb hard;
one  also  has  to  beat  the  other  climbers  as  the  pyramid  gets narrower  and narrower.
While this system tends to promote those with the required skills to best play the game, it causes much stress and wasted effort. 
不仅要努力攀登；
随着金字塔变得越来越窄，一个人还必须击败其他攀登者。
虽然，这个系统倾向于提升那些具备技能的人，来最好地玩游戏，但它会造成很大的压力和浪费。

Since so many are used to thinking that employment-based income is the only way to get ahead, they spend all their effort on their job to the detriment of their home life, despite employers paying lip service to work-life balance. 
由于很多人认为就业收入，是获得成功的唯一途径，尽管雇主口头上承诺工作与生活的平衡，但他们将所有精力都花在工作上，这损害了家庭生活。

Here, one solution is to moderate one's career ambitions. 
在这里，一种解决方案是缓和一个人的职业抱负。

After all, realizing at an early point that going all the way not only  depends  on  skills,  but  also  requires  100%  dedication,  reading  time,  and possibly  some  ethical  compromises,  one  can  aid  in  the  sorting  process  by consciously seeking positions suitable to one's more moderate aims and avoiding unnecessary competition. 
毕竟，早点意识到这条路不仅取决于技能，还需要100%的奉献精神、阅读时间，可能还有一些道德上的妥协，就可以有意识地寻找更适合自己的职位，来帮助缓和目标设定，并避免不必要的竞争。

Those with less foresight are forced to lower their aims through career burn out.
In  summary,  the  work  system  is  designed  so  that  most  people  have  been specialized to as far down the production chain as possible. 
那些缺乏远见的人因职业倦怠而被迫降低目标。
总之，工作系统的设计使大多数人尽可能专注于生产链的下游。

Specialization makes people  replaceable  either  directly  through  advances  in  technology  or  through competition between many others with similar skills. 
通过与具有相似技能的许多人之间的竞争，专业化使人可替代。

Specialists are like cogs in the system and they tend to have very simple interfaces with it.
专家就像系统中的齿轮，他们往往有非常简单的接口。
