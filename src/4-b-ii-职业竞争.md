As  mentioned  above,  specialization  has  another  problem.  Competition  is
very difficult because it's hard to compare the actual skills of the specialists. In
some  cases,  the  desired  skill  level  for  a  position  is  reached  by  several
competitors, who are all sufficiently good. If there are plenty of competitors, the
decision process breaks down, becomes fuzzy, and starts depending on things
that are less connected with the skills in demand. In those cases, getting the job
begins  to  depend  on  intangibles  which  are  generally  outside  the  control,  and
certainly outside the specialization, of the worker. Of course, there are plenty
other specialists who will sell advice on what to wear, how to format a résumé,
which clubs to join, etc. This is good for the system, but less beneficial for the
individual.
Large amounts of time are spent picking the few winners of this game. One
might argue that the function of a college education isn't so much to provide
education as it is to produce college dropouts, who are willing to accept lower
paying jobs. In other words, a college education is a sorting mechanism. It does
not stop there, though. A so-called career provides a similar sorting mechanism.
People frequently talk about climbing the corporate ladder. However, a ladder
implies that if one climbs hard enough, one eventually will get to the top. In
reality, it's more like a corporate pyramid. Not only does one have to climb hard;
one  also  has  to  beat  the  other  climbers  as  the  pyramid  gets  narrower  and
narrower.
While this system tends to promote those with the required skills to best play
the game, it causes much stress and wasted effort. Since so many are used to
thinking that employment-based income is the only way to get ahead, they spend
all their effort on their job to the detriment of their home life, despite employers
paying lip service to work-life balance. Here, one solution is to moderate one's
career ambitions. After all, realizing at an early point that going all the way not
only  depends  on  skills,  but  also  requires  100%  dedication,  reading  time,  and
possibly  some  ethical  compromises,  one  can  aid  in  the  sorting  process  by
consciously seeking positions suitable to one's more moderate aims and avoiding
unnecessary competition. Those with less foresight are forced to lower their aims

through career burn out.
In  summary,  the  work  system  is  designed  so  that  most  people  have  been
specialized to as far down the production chain as possible. Specialization makes
people  replaceable  either  directly  through  advances  in  technology  or  through
competition between many others with similar skills. Specialists are like cogs in
the system and they tend to have very simple interfaces with it.
