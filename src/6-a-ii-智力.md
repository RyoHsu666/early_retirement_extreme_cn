Throughout their education (see Sigmoids, logistic curves, and the maximum power  principle),  people  have  been  told  what  to  think,  and  throughout  their careers  (see  Career)  they  have  been  told  what  to  do  and  what  to  say. 

 Being constantly  bombarded  with  "facts"  and  opinions,  many  people  simply  adopt them  as  their  own  (see  Succession  and  the  cycle  of  change). 

 Most  people therefore  do  not  think  for  themselves,  but  rely  on  others  to  do  it  for  them. 

Consequently,  many  people  follow  authority,  rely  on  experts,  and  get  their opinions from pundits and the Internet. 

Critical thinking doesn't come naturally. 

It is a discipline that can be learned, but  unfortunately  schools  don't  seem  to  do  a  good  job  of  teaching  it. 

 When critical  thinking  is  taught,  it's  typically  compartmentalized  to  the  student's particular specialization. 

Consequently, a person may be able to think critically when it comes to the life cycle of the fruit fly or late 19th century Indian fiction (see  The  cost  of  specialization),  but  is  otherwise  unable  to  apply  the  methods elsewhere, because the general principles of rational thought are not taught. 

Yet without  critical  thinking  skills,  there's  no  way  of  correctly  solving  problems yourself (see Building blocks) and no way of critically questioning your life and your surroundings. 

Relying on outside analysis of those areas restricts the scope of choices, whereas your own critical analysis and synthesis create new choices. 

It makes you a leader rather than a follower. 

The average person is a follower. 

Aside from being able to think, one should also know what to think about. 

If thinking is the tool, knowledge is the resource. 

It's only by combining these that productive solutions can be formed. 

There are few combinations more dangerous than  an  intelligent  person  without  knowledge,  experience,  and  wisdom. 

 In general, the wider the scope of one's knowledge, the greater one's ability to think laterally  and  the  more  creative  the  solutions  become. 

 The  Renaissance  man should therefore acquire knowledge from many different fields so as to have the intellectual  horsepower  to  solve  many  different  kinds  of  problems. 

 Also,  he should  acknowledge  that  breadth  of  knowledge  is  inherently  valuable  and  that learning should not stop when leaving school. 

Intellectual goals for someone aspiring to be a Renaissance man are to be  able  to  prioritize  the  relevance  of  information  and  be  able  to  quickly research  and  find  relevant  information  in  many  different  areas. 

 Learn independently and have an interest in doing so. 

have  enough  generalized  knowledge  to  be  able  to  understand  the information and put it into the context of a mental framework, a model or a procedure, and use it to ask further questions. 

recognize  which  problems  the  model  applies  to,  take  the  solution  to  one problem, generalize it, and apply it to another problem. 

be  able  to  critically  analyze  the  model,  refine  it,  and  combine  different models  to  achieve  an  objective. 

 Practice  critical  thinking  in  all  aspects  of life to reach a degree of rational certainty. 

Be open to new ideas but do not accept anything uncritically. 

synthesize  interdisciplinary  information  and  laterally  connect  similarities which  are  not  immediately  apparent,  discovering  new  models  and procedures. 

evaluate  different  methods,  models,  and  procedures  while  effectively ranking  them  for  utility,  and  picking  the  best  one  while  recognizing  the pertinence  of  other  methods. 

 Pursue  relevant  and  correct  knowledge persistently and consistently. 

Master the fundamentals.
