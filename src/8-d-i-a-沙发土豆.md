Since  there  are  many  different  human  behaviors,  human  bodies  come  in many different shapes and sizes. 

A popular model now dominating two-thirds of the  American  market  is  the  CouchPotato500,  adapted  to  a  sedentary  life  and capable of processing large amounts of Twinkies79 while sitting and staring at a monitor for up to 16 hours a day. 

The problem with the CouchPotato500 model is that it eventually requires prescription drugs to compensate for various system imbalances  obtained  from  eating  a  diet  of  meat,  starch,  and  corn  syrup,  drugs which require some kind of insurance scheme to keep personal costs down. 

It's typically  in  pain,  being  overloaded  with  weight,  meaning  more  drugs  and typically  less  activity,  thus  exacerbating  the  problem  further. 

It  then  requires auxiliary motorized assistance to move farther than a few city blocks, something which is almost exclusively possible with personal car ownership.
