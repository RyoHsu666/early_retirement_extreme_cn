Few consciously think about complex strategies in daily living.

很少人认真思考过日常生活的复杂策略。

 On a daily
basis, a functional strategy is invisible.

在基本的日常生活中，基本的策略是不可见的。

 Rarely do we step back and re-examine
our strategy (lifestyle design). 

我们很少会后退和重新检验我们的策略（生活方式设计）。

Most of the time we simply adopt the tactics that
are handed down through the system without a second thought (see The Lock-
on).

大多数时间我们只是用手头的系统做了简单的适配，没有再多想一秒（参见[锁住](4-锁住.md)）。


Now, it's possible to improve normal consumer budgets by several percent by
utilizing tips and hacks to optimize the efficiency of existing tactics.

现在，通过利用小提示和优化存在的战术的效率，提高一定百分比的日常的消费预算是有可能的。

 Keep in
mind, however, that hacking existing methods isn't going to accomplish the same
level of satisfaction as devising new methods that are more suitable to the new
strategy. 

记住，然而，这种优化已有方法和发展出更有适应性的策略的满足感步骤一个层次上。

One doesn't win a trench war against machine guns by improving the
cavalry.  

提高骑兵的不能在堑壕战中战胜机枪。

Substantial  improvements  don't  happen  incrementally  by  patching
existing methods; they require a complete redesign.

令人满意的改进不可能是在已有方法上打补丁实现；它们需要完全地重新设计。

Until now, we have concentrated on the theoretical foundations and guiding
principles of the Renaissance life. 

直到现在，我们才集中到文艺复兴式生活的理论基础和指导原则。

In this chapter I'll describe the trees of this
forest. 

这章中我会描述这片森林里的树木。

Just as early humans built fires and shelter and planted seeds to modify
their environment, we should modify our environment in ways that are beneficial
rather than detrimental to our goals. 

就像早期人类生火和种植种子来改变他们的环境，我们应该以一直互利的方式修改我们的环境，而不是为了我们的目标不择手段。

When the environment can't be changed,
we'll adapt ourselves to flow along with the environment instead of struggling
against  it. 

当环境不能改变时，我们会让自己适应环境而不挣扎着对抗它。

 It  should  be  realized  that  it'll  rarely  be  possible  to  change  the
environment on a grand scale and build a utopia--that is, unless you and the rest
of the world all do what I say. 

已经被意识到的是，大规模地改造环境和建立一个乌托邦是几乎不可能的——也就是，除非你和世界上的其他人都这么做。

Most tactics will therefore be executed in the
current  environment.  

很多战术会在当前的环境里执行。

However,  they'll  often  be  carried  out  with  an  entirely
different  goal  in  mind--becoming  independently  wealthy  and  financially
independent within five years.

然而，它们都会带着一个完全不同的目标——五年内财富独立和经济独立。

The methods for doing so will be simple. 

这么做的方法会是很简单的。

I won't present any tips that haven't
been seen before and which one can't find described in detail in hundreds of
other  books. 

我不会一一列出所有的未曾见过的小提示，这些都是在几百本书里也找不出来的。

 Success  won't  depend  on  becoming  famous  on  the  Internet  or
getting  a  book  deal,  nor  will  it  depend  on  a  timely  participation  in  a  market
bubble  of  junk  bonds,  internet  companies,  real  estate,  gold,  or  tulips.  

成功不依赖于成为网红，或者成为畅销书作者，也不依赖于某个特定时间的市场泡沫，互联网工作，不动产，黄金和郁金香。

It  also
won't  depend  on  successfully  starting  your  own  business. 

它也不依赖于成功开始你自己的生意。

 You  won't  need  to
develop a particular specialized skill such as real estate flipping. 

你不需要发展一种特别的技能例如不动产翻转。

In fact, if you
have a job, keep it. However, using the methods in a way that aligns your goals
and  side  effects  persistently  and  consistently  to  achieve  financial  or  job-
independence is not easy.

事实上，如果你还有工作，留着它。然而，使用这种方法来接近你的目标，侧面影响会永久和持续地获取经济或工作——独立不是容易的。

 You must be willing to change your frame of mind and
conquer old habits. 

你必须愿意改变你的思维框架和战胜旧的习惯。

In particular, you must be willing to do things that 95% of
the population won't be able to understand and 99% won't be willing to do. 

特别的，你必须愿意做95%的人不愿意理解的事，和99%不愿意做的事。

This
means that you must be exceedingly confident that you're doing the right thing,
which is why 90% of this book is dedicated to the development of a coherent
philosophy.

这就意味着你必须极度自信于你做的是对的，这也是为什么这本书90%都在开发一种一致性的哲学。

Freedom is attained by creating a large gap between production (revenue)
and consumption (expenses). 

自由是在生产（收入）和消耗（消费）间划出很大的间隔。

This can be done in two ways--earning more or
spending less. Nothing new there.
Which of the two you prefer depends on individual circumstances. If you're
easily capable of producing more, you'll frame freedom as the opportunity to
produce  more.  If  producing  more  requires  significant  effort,  you'll  frame
freedom as not having to produce more. In an affluent and wealthy society, the
latter is much more easily achieved by most, including myself. There was and is
no  way  I  could  increase  my  income  by  a  factor  of  four,  but  it  was  certainly
possible to reduce my expenses to a quarter of their former level. I think this
holds for the greater part of the bell curve of incomes. Unless you're very poor
(income <  $4,000  /  year)  or  very  rich  (income  >  $400,000  /  year),  boosting
income is very difficult. If done intelligently, a little money will go a long way.
Unfortunately, in this age money is rarely spent intelligently. So by practicing
intelligent  asset  management,  it's  possible  to  live  wealthily  without  spending
nearly as much as the average.
On an absolute scale, spending less also allows for much greater choice in
how  you  earn  your  money.  Currently,  the  money  I  spend  could  be  acquired
through a part-time job as a burger flipper--just imagine the riches a full-time job
could bring. Alternatively, I currently acquire my income as an amateur asset
manager or capitalist using a little over five years of personal savings as  my
capital base (see Financial independence and investing). Since being a capitalist
takes very little effort when you don't have to write progress reports or win new
customers,  I  can  dedicate  most  of  my  time  to  my  primary  passion,  which  is
writing. The strategy described in this chapter focuses on living inexpensively in
a culture dedicated to extravagance, productivity, and material waste. It follows
these guidelines:
Reduce wants and needs from the marketplace to a minimum to decouple
the buy-work connection.
Decrease  the  volume  and  size  but  increase  the  sophistication  of  your
activities and possessions.
Measure prosperity by less activity, not more. Do fewer useless things.
Work for the purpose of earning money for no more than five years of your

life or five hours a week.
Avoid generating waste and find ways to use the waste of others.
Learn to use the system to your advantage, but don't be evil!
Serve yourself rather than having others serve you. Instead, help them.
Keep running costs down but pay for value.
Maintain health to avoid the personal and monetary cost of sickness.
Build up the capital to live as a capitalist or the skills to always find a new
job.
Focus on productive assets rather than stuff.
Focus on developing skills rather than on passive entertainment.
Gain the maximum in satisfaction with the minimum expenditure of money
and energy.
Reintegration is an important part of this design. Normal life (see The lock-
in)  has  maximized  separation  (see  Economic  degrees  of  freedom)  due  to  an
underlying engineering frame of mind (minimize degrees of freedom) and the
economic  idea  of  comparative  advantage,  with  outsourcing  being  its  latest
manifestation.  This  separation  occurs  not  just  over  the  span  of  decades  with
schooling, working, and retirement happening in three separate time periods, but
also on a daily basis, where people drive dozens of miles away from their home
for  a  set  amount  of  hours  in  their  separate  cars  and  then  return  late  to  their
separate houses in the early evening to consume stuff acquired elsewhere.
What worked for me was reintegrating much of this behavior, to eliminate
the personal inefficiencies this way of life creates. For instance, I lived close to
work; most of my work I do at home, because it's mostly telecommuting work. I
don't dress up for work, but according to season. I get around not by car, but by
foot and bicycle, which provides free exercise. I retired from my career, but I
still work, and I still learn. Hence, I no longer get divided and conquered under
the guise of comparative advantage.
In the following descriptions I have omitted many details of implementation-
-consider  them  left  as  exercises  for  the  student--whose  inclusion  would
otherwise  result  in  this  book  being  several  hundred  pages  longer.  All  the
technical details can be learned from other books and websites in a matter of
months. I trust that the reader, after hearing about a specific method, will be able
to fill in the blanks. For instance, if I suggest making your own laundry detergent
or a self-watering container, I trust the reader to find the pertinent details on the
Internet. This leaves the technicalities to the reader and I can restrict myself to
pointing out what to look for and how to devise a strategy.
