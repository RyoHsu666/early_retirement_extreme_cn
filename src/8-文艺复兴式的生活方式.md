Few consciously think about complex strategies in daily living. On a daily
basis, a functional strategy is invisible. Rarely do we step back and re-examine
our strategy (lifestyle design). Most of the time we simply adopt the tactics that
are handed down through the system without a second thought (see The Lock-
on).
Now, it's possible to improve normal consumer budgets by several percent by
utilizing tips and hacks to optimize the efficiency of existing tactics. Keep in
mind, however, that hacking existing methods isn't going to accomplish the same
level of satisfaction as devising new methods that are more suitable to the new
strategy. One doesn't win a trench war against machine guns by improving the
cavalry.  Substantial  improvements  don't  happen  incrementally  by  patching
existing methods; they require a complete redesign.
Until now, we have concentrated on the theoretical foundations and guiding
principles of the Renaissance life. In this chapter I'll describe the trees of this
forest. Just as early humans built fires and shelter and planted seeds to modify
their environment, we should modify our environment in ways that are beneficial
rather than detrimental to our goals. When the environment can't be changed,
we'll adapt ourselves to flow along with the environment instead of struggling
against  it.  It  should  be  realized  that  it'll  rarely  be  possible  to  change  the
environment on a grand scale and build a utopia--that is, unless you and the rest
of the world all do what I say. Most tactics will therefore be executed in the
current  environment.  However,  they'll  often  be  carried  out  with  an  entirely
different  goal  in  mind--becoming  independently  wealthy  and  financially
independent within five years.
The methods for doing so will be simple. I won't present any tips that haven't
been seen before and which one can't find described in detail in hundreds of
other  books.  Success  won't  depend  on  becoming  famous  on  the  Internet  or
getting  a  book  deal,  nor  will  it  depend  on  a  timely  participation  in  a  market
bubble  of  junk  bonds,  internet  companies,  real  estate,  gold,  or  tulips.  It  also
won't  depend  on  successfully  starting  your  own  business.  You  won't  need  to
develop a particular specialized skill such as real estate flipping. In fact, if you
have a job, keep it. However, using the methods in a way that aligns your goals
and  side  effects  persistently  and  consistently  to  achieve  financial  or  job-
independence is not easy. You must be willing to change your frame of mind and
conquer old habits. In particular, you must be willing to do things that 95% of
the population won't be able to understand and 99% won't be willing to do. This
means that you must be exceedingly confident that you're doing the right thing,
which is why 90% of this book is dedicated to the development of a coherent
philosophy.
Freedom is attained by creating a large gap between production (revenue)
and consumption (expenses). This can be done in two ways--earning more or
spending less. Nothing new there.
Which of the two you prefer depends on individual circumstances. If you're
easily capable of producing more, you'll frame freedom as the opportunity to
produce  more.  If  producing  more  requires  significant  effort,  you'll  frame
freedom as not having to produce more. In an affluent and wealthy society, the
latter is much more easily achieved by most, including myself. There was and is
no  way  I  could  increase  my  income  by  a  factor  of  four,  but  it  was  certainly
possible to reduce my expenses to a quarter of their former level. I think this
holds for the greater part of the bell curve of incomes. Unless you're very poor
(income <  $4,000  /  year)  or  very  rich  (income  >  $400,000  /  year),  boosting
income is very difficult. If done intelligently, a little money will go a long way.
Unfortunately, in this age money is rarely spent intelligently. So by practicing
intelligent  asset  management,  it's  possible  to  live  wealthily  without  spending
nearly as much as the average.
On an absolute scale, spending less also allows for much greater choice in
how  you  earn  your  money.  Currently,  the  money  I  spend  could  be  acquired
through a part-time job as a burger flipper--just imagine the riches a full-time job
could bring. Alternatively, I currently acquire my income as an amateur asset
manager or capitalist using a little over five years of personal savings as  my
capital base (see Financial independence and investing). Since being a capitalist
takes very little effort when you don't have to write progress reports or win new
customers,  I  can  dedicate  most  of  my  time  to  my  primary  passion,  which  is
writing. The strategy described in this chapter focuses on living inexpensively in
a culture dedicated to extravagance, productivity, and material waste. It follows
these guidelines:
Reduce wants and needs from the marketplace to a minimum to decouple
the buy-work connection.
Decrease  the  volume  and  size  but  increase  the  sophistication  of  your
activities and possessions.
Measure prosperity by less activity, not more. Do fewer useless things.
Work for the purpose of earning money for no more than five years of your

life or five hours a week.
Avoid generating waste and find ways to use the waste of others.
Learn to use the system to your advantage, but don't be evil!
Serve yourself rather than having others serve you. Instead, help them.
Keep running costs down but pay for value.
Maintain health to avoid the personal and monetary cost of sickness.
Build up the capital to live as a capitalist or the skills to always find a new
job.
Focus on productive assets rather than stuff.
Focus on developing skills rather than on passive entertainment.
Gain the maximum in satisfaction with the minimum expenditure of money
and energy.
Reintegration is an important part of this design. Normal life (see The lock-
in)  has  maximized  separation  (see  Economic  degrees  of  freedom)  due  to  an
underlying engineering frame of mind (minimize degrees of freedom) and the
economic  idea  of  comparative  advantage,  with  outsourcing  being  its  latest
manifestation.  This  separation  occurs  not  just  over  the  span  of  decades  with
schooling, working, and retirement happening in three separate time periods, but
also on a daily basis, where people drive dozens of miles away from their home
for  a  set  amount  of  hours  in  their  separate  cars  and  then  return  late  to  their
separate houses in the early evening to consume stuff acquired elsewhere.
What worked for me was reintegrating much of this behavior, to eliminate
the personal inefficiencies this way of life creates. For instance, I lived close to
work; most of my work I do at home, because it's mostly telecommuting work. I
don't dress up for work, but according to season. I get around not by car, but by
foot and bicycle, which provides free exercise. I retired from my career, but I
still work, and I still learn. Hence, I no longer get divided and conquered under
the guise of comparative advantage.
In the following descriptions I have omitted many details of implementation-
-consider  them  left  as  exercises  for  the  student--whose  inclusion  would
otherwise  result  in  this  book  being  several  hundred  pages  longer.  All  the
technical details can be learned from other books and websites in a matter of
months. I trust that the reader, after hearing about a specific method, will be able
to fill in the blanks. For instance, if I suggest making your own laundry detergent
or a self-watering container, I trust the reader to find the pertinent details on the
Internet. This leaves the technicalities to the reader and I can restrict myself to
pointing out what to look for and how to devise a strategy.
