Many things--books in particular come to mind--are sufficiently well-built to last  longer  than  you  as  their  owner  maintain  an  interest  in  them.
许多东西——尤其是书籍——都经过精心打造，可以比你保存得更久，因为它们的主人对它们保持着兴趣。
Instead  of storing  them,  which  increases  the  demand  for  housing  and  new  goods,  I  feel almost  obligated  to  reduce  this  pressure  by  passing  them  along  when  I'm  no longer  interested,  so  that  other  people  may  enjoy  them.
与其储存它们，这增加了对住房和新商品的需求，我觉得几乎有义务在我不再感兴趣时通过传递它们来减轻这种压力，以便其他人可以享受它们。
For  similar  reasons,  I also always attempt to buy things used.
出于类似的原因，我也总是尝试购买使用过的东西。
Not only does this keep the pressure off of  people's  homes,  it  also  keeps  the  pressure  off  landfills,  since  normal  people don't  think  twice  about  throwing  perfectly  functional  items  in  the  trash  when their space becomes too crowded by stuff.
这不仅可以减轻人们家中的压力，还可以减轻垃圾填埋场的压力，因为当空间变得过于拥挤时，普通人会不假思索地将功能完善的物品扔进垃圾桶。
In fact, any depreciating asset should always be bought used if you must own it at all.
事实上，如果你必须拥有任何贬值的资产，就应该一直购买和使用它。
Serial ownership is one of the biggest  contributions  you  can  make  towards  counteracting  environmental problems  (climate  change,  resource  depletion,  and  population  pressure),  as  the resources required to build and transport stuff is generally higher than those used to repair and maintain stuff, and even the resources used to heat and light your home.
串化所有权是应对环境问题（气候变化、资源枯竭和人口压力）的最大贡献之一，因为建造和运输材料所需的资源通常高于维修和维护所需的资源，甚至高于用来给家里供暖和照明的资源。
