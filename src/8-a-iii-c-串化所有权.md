Many things--books in particular come to mind--are sufficiently well-built to last  longer  than  you  as  their  owner  maintain  an  interest  in  them.

Instead  of storing  them,  which  increases  the  demand  for  housing  and  new  goods,  I  feel almost  obligated  to  reduce  this  pressure  by  passing  them  along  when  I'm  no longer  interested,  so  that  other  people  may  enjoy  them.

For  similar  reasons,  I also always attempt to buy things used.

Not only does this keep the pressure off of  people's  homes,  it  also  keeps  the  pressure  off  landfills,  since  normal  people don't  think  twice  about  throwing  perfectly  functional  items  in  the  trash  when their space becomes too crowded by stuff.

In fact, any depreciating asset should always be bought used if you must own it at all.

Serial ownership is one of the biggest  contributions  you  can  make  towards  counteracting  environmental problems  (climate  change,  resource  depletion,  and  population  pressure),  as  the resources required to build and transport stuff is generally higher than those used to repair and maintain stuff, and even the resources used to heat and light your home.
