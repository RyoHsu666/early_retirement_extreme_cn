Many  offices  have  a  coffee  club  where  money  is  contributed  to  buying  a shared coffee machine and coffee suppliess.

This saves everybody the expense of each buying their own individual coffee machine.

It takes initiative to establish such clubs, so don't wait for someone else to do it.

If you have an idea, propose it;  people  just  might  say  yes.

Here  are  some  examples  of  things  that  can  be purchased  and  shared:  tools,  sports  equipment,  A/V  equipment,  computer equipment, vehicles, boats, appliances, etc.

It seems to be a fact of life that very few  people  will  take  the  initiative  to  establish  something  new,  but  many  will gladly go along once someone proposes it.

Here are some examples of people to start a club with: friends, family, co-workers, team members, etc.

Such clubs can also  be  established  with  things  everybody  already  owns.

I  have  heard  of households rotating kitchen  appliances  using  the theory that ice  cream  makers, waffle  irons,  grills,  and  similar  rarely  used  appliances  might  not  see  daily  use.

That way everybody gets a chance to try them out.

I find that these arrangements work best when everybody trusts one another.
