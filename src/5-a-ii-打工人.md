A working man is someone who doesn't collect a salary or other associated benefits.

His income is uncertain, possibly because he takes on smaller projects that only last days, weeks, or perhaps months, and he knows and plans for this.

It's  likely  he  does  some  form  of  freelance  consulting  or  works  for  multiple employers in short order, one at a time.

A working man should therefore not have  a  tightly-coupled  budget  like  the  salary  man,  as  job  loss  can  result  in homelessness or the inability to purchase products.

Therefore, the working man often establishes an emergency fund (see Financial cash flow cycles) to introduce some  slack  into  the  system,  which  allows  him  to  continue  consuming  during periods with less or no income.

This fund covers the budget, at least temporarily, if  the  money  flow  is  reduced  or  cut  off.

An  alternative  is  to  purchase unemployment insurance.

A similar alternative is to use credit cards.

However, with  sporadic  income,  credit  will  be  more  expensive  for  the  working  man compared to the salary man, who earns a steadier income.

The purpose of an emergency fund or unemployment insurance is to cover unexpected expenses or lack of income for the amount of time it takes to find another job.

An industrial example of a loosely coupled linear system is a mining operation, where miners carry their own rebreathers.

Normally, a mine functions like  an  assembly  line,  but  if  one  link  fails,  which  would  be  catastrophic  if everybody was hooked up to the same line of oxygen, it doesn't impact the entire line  catastrophically.

Mining  operations  are  loosely  coupled for  precisely  this reason! The principal financial difference between a salary man and a working man, as defined here, is the amount of fiscal coupling.

The salary man has easy access to credit,  and  if  he  chooses  to  accept  this  burden,  he  must  maintain  a  job  to shoulder it.

A working man will also often, but not always, have easy access to credit.

This means, as mentioned above, that the working man must maintain a financial  buffer  to  create  slack  in  the  system.

20  The  lack  of  easy  credit  also means fewer obligations.

Working men are closer to a situation where they can decouple themselves from a particular job or career.

In fact, working men tend to have  a  much  easier  time  finding  jobs  than  professional  specialists.

The  latter must go to where the jobs are, which can often result in steep costs of living, whereas less specialized jobs can be found everywhere.

If the working man puts some effort into job searching, he should be able to move through a succession of employment contracts.

While the lack of a steady paycheck may seem risky, it's actually safer, as the working man has been conditioned to the situation of having  to  find  new  jobs--he  actually  thinks  of  them  as  clients  rather  than employers, and thus considers it normal.

A salary man is rarely without a job, but when he is, it's a high-stress event, almost like a death in the family.

Still, the consumer pattern of a working man is similar to that of the salary man.

As  working  men  generally  earn  less,  there's  a  drive--you  only  need  to watch a commercial from your local college to see how this works--from the working class to the salaried class, as the latter is able to spend more and is hence is perceived to live a better life.

The public perception of a link between cost of living and quality of life is strong
