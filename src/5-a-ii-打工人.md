A working man is someone who doesn't collect a salary or other associated benefits.
打工人是指不领取工资或其他相关福利的人。
His income is uncertain, possibly because he takes on smaller projects that only last days, weeks, or perhaps months, and he knows and plans for this.
他的收入是不确定的，可能是因为他承担的小项目只持续几天、几周或几个月，他知道并计划这样做。
It's  likely  he  does  some  form  of  freelance  consulting  or  works  for  multiple employers in short order, one at a time.
他很可能会做一些形式的自由职业咨询，或者在短期内为多个雇主工作，一次一个。
A working man should therefore not have  a  tightly-coupled  budget  like  the  salary  man,  as  job  loss  can  result  in homelessness or the inability to purchase products.
因此，打工人不应该像领薪人那样拥有紧密耦合的预算，因为失业可能导致无家可归或无法购买产品。
Therefore, the working man often establishes an emergency fund (see Financial cash flow cycles) to introduce some  slack  into  the  system,  which  allows  him  to  continue  consuming  during periods with less or no income.
因此，打工人通常会建立一个应急基金（参见[现金流循环]()），以便在系统中引入一些松弛，从而允许他在收入较少或没有收入的时期继续消费。
This fund covers the budget, at least temporarily, if  the  money  flow  is  reduced  or  cut  off.
如果资金流减少或中断，这笔资金至少暂时用于支付预算。
An  alternative  is  to  purchase unemployment insurance.
另一种选择是购买失业保险。
A similar alternative is to use credit cards.
类似的替代方法是使用信用卡。
However, with  sporadic  income,  credit  will  be  more  expensive  for  the  working  man compared to the salary man, who earns a steadier income.
然而，对于零散的收入来说，与收入更稳定的工薪族相比，信贷更为昂贵。

The purpose of an emergency fund or unemployment insurance is to cover unexpected expenses or lack of income for the amount of time it takes to find another job.
紧急基金或失业保险的目的是，为在找到另一份工作所需的时间内支付意外开支或缺少的收入。
An industrial example of a loosely coupled linear system is a mining operation, where miners carry their own rebreathers.
松散耦合线性系统的一个工业例子是采矿作业，矿工携带自己的再呼吸器。
Normally, a mine functions like  an  assembly  line,  but  if  one  link  fails,  which  would  be  catastrophic  if everybody was hooked up to the same line of oxygen, it doesn't impact the entire line  catastrophically.
正常情况下，矿井的功能类似于装配线，但如果一个环节发生故障，如果每个人都连接到同一条氧气管线，这将是灾难性的。
Mining  operations  are  loosely  coupled for  precisely  this reason! 
正是由于这个原因，采矿作业是松散耦合的！

The principal financial difference between a salary man and a working man, as defined here, is the amount of fiscal coupling.
这里定义的工薪族和打工人之间的主要财务差异是财政耦合的数量。
The salary man has easy access to credit,  and  if  he  chooses  to  accept  this  burden,  he  must  maintain  a  job  to shoulder it.
领薪人很容易获得信贷，如果他选择接受这一负担，他必须维持一份工作来承担。
A working man will also often, but not always, have easy access to credit.
一个打工人也经常（但并非总是）容易获得信贷。
This means, as mentioned above, that the working man must maintain a financial  buffer  to  create  slack  in  the  system.
这意味着，如上所述，打工人必须维持一个财务缓冲，以创造系统中的松弛。
20  The  lack  of  easy  credit  also means fewer obligations.
缺乏宽松信贷也意味着债务减少。
Working men are closer to a situation where they can decouple themselves from a particular job or career.
打工人更接近于脱离特定工作或职业的情况。
In fact, working men tend to have  a  much  easier  time  finding  jobs  than  professional  specialists.
事实上，打工人往往比专业专家更容易找到工作。
The  latter must go to where the jobs are, which can often result in steep costs of living, whereas less specialized jobs can be found everywhere.
后者必须去工作所在的地方，这往往会导致生活成本的急剧上升，而不太专业的工作却随处可见。
If the working man puts some effort into job searching, he should be able to move through a succession of employment contracts.
如果打工人在找工作上投入一些精力，他应该能够获得一系列的雇佣合同。
While the lack of a steady paycheck may seem risky, it's actually safer, as the working man has been conditioned to the situation of having  to  find  new  jobs--he  actually  thinks  of  them  as  clients  rather  than employers, and thus considers it normal.
虽然缺少稳定的薪水似乎有风险，但实际上更安全，因为打工人已经习惯于必须找到新工作的情况——他实际上把他们看作客户而不是雇主，并认为这是正常的。
A salary man is rarely without a job, but when he is, it's a high-stress event, almost like a death in the family.
领薪人很少没有工作，但当他失业时，这是一个高压力事件，几乎就像家庭中的死亡。

Still, the consumer pattern of a working man is similar to that of the salary man.
不过，领薪人的消费模式与打工人相似。
As  working  men  generally  earn  less,  there's  a  drive--you  only  need  to watch a commercial from your local college to see how this works--from the working class to the salaried class, as the latter is able to spend more and is hence is perceived to live a better life.
由于打工人的收入普遍较低，因此有一种从打工阶层到工薪阶层的动力——你只需观看当地大学的广告，就可以了解这种动力是如何发挥作用的——因为工薪阶层能够花更多的钱，因此被认为生活得更好。
The public perception of a link between cost of living and quality of life is strong 
公众强烈认为生活费用和生活质量之间存在联系
