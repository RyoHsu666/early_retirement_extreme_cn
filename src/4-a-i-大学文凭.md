A high school diploma used to be sufficient to obtain jobs in most vocations except  a  few  professions  which  required  advanced  studies,  like engineering, science, medicine, accounting, and law. 
高中文凭曾经足以在大多数职业中找到工作，除了少数需要深造的职业，如工程、科学、医学、会计和法律。
This isn't the case anymore. 
现在已经不是这样了。
Today, the only  way  to  join  the  rank  of  salaried  professionals  is  with  a  college  degree, despite  the  fact  that  85%  of  college  graduates  eventually  find  jobs  in  a  field different from the one they graduated in. 
今天，加入受薪专业人士行列的唯一途径是拥有大学学位，尽管事实上 85% 的大学毕业生找到的工作和他们所学的专业不同。
This is no surprise, as normal office job functions generally require little knowledge of underwater basket-weaving, 19th century  Hungarian  clog  art,  or  other  things  of  academic  interest. 
这并不奇怪，因为正常的办公室工作，通常不需要水下篮子编织、19 世纪匈牙利木屐艺术或其他有趣的学术知识。
 A  college degree has  thus  come  to  serve  as  an  admission  ticket  to  the  white-collar  job market,  as  employers  deemed  that  the  selective  process  of  getting  through  a college education is perfect for selecting the most mentally disciplined workers.
因此，大学学位已成为白领就业市场的入场券，因为雇主认为，通过大学教育的筛选的人，非常适合选出受纪律约束的工人。
Salaried,  white-collar  jobs  are  desirable  because  they're  thought  to  provide superior  and  stable  pay  and  fringe  benefits. 
有薪的白领工作是炙手可热的，因为它们被认为提供了优越稳定的薪酬和附加福利。
 They're  also  perceived  as  less strenuous  and  less  dangerous  than  manual  labor. 
与体力劳动相比，他们也被认为不那么费力，也不那么危险。
 Today,  there  are  notable exceptions to this perception. 
今天，这种看法有明显的例外。
Lifestyle diseases associated with sedentary stress caused by pushing paper forms around with little autonomy and few tangible results diminish the health advantages compared to the small chance of having your arm ripped off in a centrifuge, say. 
比方说，手臂在离心机中被扯断的可能性很小，由于在没有自主权、几乎没有实际结果，久坐不动的办公室工作，产生的压力相关的疾病可能性更大。
In addition, a skilled machinist or driver can often make more than a mid-level office worker with equal years of tenure, and  be  able  to  find  work  anywhere. 
此外，熟练的机械师或司机，通常可以比同等年限的上班族赚更多的钱，并且可以在任何地方找到工作。
 A  self-employed  electrician  or  plumber should be able to clear six figures and set his own hours. 
自雇电工或水管工应该能够清除六位数，并设定自己的工作时间。
Yet young people seem unaware of this, and thus everybody, even those with no aptitude or desire for intellectual challenges, try very hard to get into college no matter how it may impair their future earnings and financial independence.
然而年轻人似乎没有意识到这一点，因此每个人，即使是那些没有才能或渴望，进行智力挑战的人，不管对他们未来的收入和经济独立的损害，都非常努力地进入大学。

While the service sector has slowly grown, and as employers have come to prefer college-educated job applicants, demand for college degrees has gone up.
虽然服务业增长缓慢，而且雇主越来越喜欢受过大学教育的求职者，使对大学学位的需求增加。
Colleges and universities have responded by lowering academic standards and raising their prices, much like other producers of consumer goods and services respond  to  rising  demand. 
学院和大学的回应是，降低学术标准和提高价格，就像其他消费品和服务生产商，应对不断增长的需求一样。
 This  has  resulted  in  an  overabundance  of  college-educated  people  with  useless  degrees. 
这导致过多的受过大学教育的人拥有无用的学位。
 This  creates  structural  unemployment, which  is  generally  bad  for  society,  bad  for  the  unemployed,  but  good  for employers. 
这会造成结构性失业，这通常对社会不利，对失业者不利，但对雇主有利。
 Hence,  the  continued  calls  for  more  education,  even  though  it's sometimes  hard  to  see  the  reason. 
因此，尽管有时很难看出原因，接受更多教育的呼吁仍在继续。
 For  instance,  it's  not  unusual  to  see  job advertisements along the lines of, "Must have a Bachelor's Degree and be able to lift 50lbs," to get a store manager job that would have been held by a high school graduate a generation ago. 
例如，看到“必须拥有学士学位并能够举起 50 磅”这样的招聘广告，才能获得一份商店经理的工作，而这种工作本应由一个高中毕业生担任。
Perhaps one will need a PhD just to man the cash register at a burger franchise one day...hey wait, what?!
也许有一天，人们需要博士学位，才能在汉堡店的收银机上工作......嘿，等等，啥？！


As universities keep lowering their standards and thus decreasingly serve as centers of higher learning, they increasingly function as issuers of credentials, where  students  have  little  purpose  other  than  trying  to  maximize  their  grade point  average  once  they  get  in. 
随着大学不断降低他们的标准，也就越来越少地充当高等教育的中心，而越来越多地充当证书的颁发者，在那里，学生除了试图在入学后最大化他们的平均绩点外，别无其他目的。
 Hence,  admissions  standards  become  the dominant factor. 
因此，录取标准成为主导因素。
Consequently, universities focus on screening methods, while students  focus  on  how  to  get  around  them. 
因此，大学专注于筛选方法，而学生则专注于如何绕过它们。
 Many  resources  are  spent  on  an endless war of attacks and counter-attacks as students and their parents attempt various strategies, including hiring highly compensated admissions consultants, to beat the admissions standards.
许多资源被用于无休止的攻击和防御，因为学生和家长尝试各种策略，包括聘请高薪招生顾问，以超过招生标准。

Many  parents  realize  that  their  children  will  have  an  advantage  if  the children  start  building  their  résumé a  little  early,  such  as  in  preschool. 
许多父母意识到，如果孩子们早点开始制作简历，比如在学龄前，他们的孩子就会更有优势。
 In  an effort to build credentials as early as possible, parents push their children into advanced  classes,  expect  high  grades,  and  call  the  children's  teachers  if  they don't get top grades. 
为了尽早建立凭据，父母将孩子推入高级班，期望获得高分，如果他们没有获得高分，就打电话给孩子的老师。
Super-parents will put in any amount of effort to ensure their children's "success." At age three they'll send the kids to day care centers that command a heavy price to make the children multilingual and continuously engage them in mentally stimulating activities for eight hours a day. 
超级父母会不遗余力地确保他们孩子的“成功”。 三岁时，他们会将孩子送到日托中心，这些中心要付出高昂的代价，才能让孩子们使用多种语言，并每天连续八小时让他们参与精神注入活动。
Parents will gladly relocate to another school district to ensure that their children go to the best schools. 
父母很乐意搬到另一个学区，以确保他们的孩子上最好的学校。
Parents will manage their science fair projects for them, projects that at the high school level are beginning to look more like undergraduate-level research projects, complete with outside collaborations. 
家长将为他们管理他们的科学博览会项目，并与外部合作完成，这些项目在高中阶段开始，但看起来更像是本科水平的研究项目。
They will pay for tutors and test prep materials, the latter of which prioritizes cramming for and passing a test rather than learning the underlying material, and they'll make sure that little Suzy and Johnny have the correct solutions for their math problems if they can't figure  them  out  themselves. 
他们将支付导师和备考材料的费用，孩子们则优先考虑补习和通过考试，而不是学习基础知识，如果他们自己弄不明白，他们将确保小苏西和小约翰尼，可以为他们的数学问题提供正确的答案 。
 Rather  than  being  left  to  figure  out  their  own playtime,  children  are  pushed  into  highly  structured,  adult-supervised extracurricular activities which take up most weeknights, to pad the résumé with the awards and honors they need to make their college applications stand out amongst the thousands of others who follow the same strategy.
孩子们并没有自己决定的游戏时间，而是被推到高度结构化、成人监督的课外活动中，这些活动占据了大部分工作日的晚上，在简历上填上他们所需的奖项和荣誉，使他们的大学申请在成千上万的人——也遵循了相同策略的人——中脱颖而出。

Once inside, the main mission has been successfully accomplished. 
一旦进入大学，任务就圆满完成了。
This is the end of the journey rather than the beginning. 
这是旅程的终点，而不是起点。
Students just have to pass the time  during  four  years  of  "edutaining"  lectures  on  arcane  subjects  while maintaining  their  grade  point  averages like  they  did  in  high  school,  dutifully cramming a few weeks before the examination date, only to forget most of what they learned as quickly as they memorized it.
学生们只需要，在四年神秘科目的“教育”讲座中打发时间，同时像高中一样保持他们的平均绩点，在考试日期前几周突击补习，结果是，他们忘记所学内容和他们记住时一样快。

If  you  are  sufficiently  smart  and  ambitious  to  get  into  a  top-ranking university,  the  value  added  by  the  educational  institution  apparently  doesn't matter  for  your  future  success. 
如果你足够聪明并雄心勃勃地进入一流大学，那么教育机构增加的价值显然与你未来的成功无关。
 In  other  words,  top-tier  institutions  don't  add value to create talent as much as they select or discover it. 
换句话说，顶级机构不会像他们选择或发现人才那样，增加价值来创造人才。
Thus, if you were smart and ambitious enough to actually get into an expensive top-tier university, you don't actually need to go to a top-tier university to succeed in life.8 
因此，如果你足够聪明和有雄心壮志，能够进入一所昂贵的一流大学，那么你实际上并不需要去一流的大学才能在生活中取得成功。
The ambitious  and  smart  people  realize  this,  drop  out  and  go  start  their  own companies. 
雄心勃勃和聪明的人意识到了这一点，他们退学并创办了自己的公司。
 Those  that  are  merely  smart,  stay,  but  quickly  learn  to  select  a college degree tailored  to  their  desired  job  or  income-level,  and  to  select  the courses  with  the  highest  grade-to-effort  level  in  order  to  maximize  what employers are looking for. 
那些只是聪明的人会留下来，但很快就会学会，选择适合他们想要的工作，或收入水平的大学学位，并选择成绩-努力水平最高的课程，以最大限度地满足雇主的需求。
I knew several people like that--very boring people--they never knew anything outside of their textbooks, and two weeks after an exam, they had forgotten practically all of what they had crammed for. 
我认识几个这样的人——非常无聊的人——他们对课本之外的任何事情一无所知，考试两周后，他们几乎忘记了所有让他们想死的东西。
Today, they're highly successful white-collar workers! The educational system works, just not according to its stated purpose: to educate.
今天，他们是非常成功的白领！ 教育系统在运作，只是没有按照其既定的目的：教育。


As students have come to view education as a product, and parents are still only  a  phone  call  away,  professors  are  "encouraged"9  to  make  education "edutaining." Students now think that if they don't learn anything, it's a failure of the teaching process, or the teachers, rather than their own failure to study. 
由于学生已经开始将教育视为一种产品，而家长只需一个电话，由此“鼓励”教授使教育“具有教育意义”。 学生们现在认为，如果他们什么都不学，那是教学过程或老师的失败，而不是他们自己的失败。
After
all,  they  paid  for  it. 
毕竟，他们花钱了。
 It's  not  what  you  can  do,  it's  what  you  can  buy,  which matters.
重要的不是你能做什么，而是你能买什么。

With  student  evaluations  now  determining  the  career  path  of  young professors, and young professors determining the career opportunities of young students, professors and students have adopted a nonaggression pact: Professors give entertaining and easy courses in exchange for good evaluations. 
现在，学生的评价决定青年教授的职业道路，青年教授决定青年学生的就业机会，教授和学生之间达成了互不侵犯的协议：教授提供有趣而简单的课程，以换取良好的评价。
This way, professors get tenure so that they can get back to publishing papers and writing grant  proposals  to  bring  in  grant  money. 
通过这种方式，教授获得终身教职，这样他们就可以重新发表论文和撰写资助提案，以获取资助资金。
 Such  "soft  money"  is  sometimes  a substantial part of their salary, and often the reason they got hired in the first place and sometimes the only way they get to keep their job. 
这种“软钱”有时是他们薪水的重要组成部分，通常也是他们最初被聘用的原因，有时也是他们保住工作的唯一途径。
Students get their degrees,  and  everybody  is  happy--except  those  that  came  to  learn  and  be challenged, and in many cases went deep into debt for the privilege. 
学生获得了学位，每个人都很高兴——除了那些来学习的和接受挑战的人，在许多情况下，为了获得特权而负债累累。
It's not so much the educational growth of the graduates that matters, or the teaching skills of the professors, as much as it's the image of the school, the imposing campus buildings, and the habits acquired from several years of following procedures, executing consistently, meeting deadlines and solving closed-end problems with limited  degrees  of  freedom,  statistically  quantified  into  a  single  grade  point average for convenient ranking and quick sorting.
重要的不是毕业生的教育成长，也不是教授的教学技能，而是学校的形象，气势磅礴的校园建筑，以及从几年来遵循程序，始终如一地执行的习惯，满足最后期限的、解法自由度有限的封闭式问题，统计量化为单个平均成绩，以便于排名和快速排序。

In the grand scheme of things, the functional purpose of universities is thus to sort students into future vocations rather than the commonly believed purpose of broadening their horizons in a useful manner. 
因此，从总体上看，大学的功能目的是，将学生分类到未来的职业中，而不是普遍认为的，以有用的方式拓宽视野。
Ask a college graduate when the last time was that they read a book from one end to the other; the answer may surprise and depress you. 
询问大学毕业生上一次完整阅读一本书是什么时候，答案可能会让你感到惊讶和沮丧。
Despite this, it's possible for individual students to get a  broad  background  in  college. 
尽管如此，个别学生仍有可能在大学获得广泛的背景。
 Smart,  if  not  street-smart,  people  abound.
聪明人，即使不是街头聪明人，也比比皆是。 
However, it will come at the cost of a high grade point average, as the student focuses too much on particular interesting subjects or courses which may not economically provide the optimal grade point return on student effort.
然而，这将以高平均绩点为代价，因为学生过多地关注特定有趣的科目或课程，这些科目或课程可能无法在经济上，为学生的努力，提供最佳的成绩点回报。

While college means different things to different people--whether it's a place for  higher  learning,  a  two-to-four-year  binge  party,  or  simply  a brand  name admission  ticket  required  by  the  job  market--the  increasing  demand  for education  and  resulting  higher  cost  mean  that  many  students  take  on  debt.
虽然大学对不同的人意味着不同的东西——无论是接受高等教育的地方，两到四年的狂欢派对，还是仅仅是就业市场所需的名牌入场券——但对教育的需求不断增加，都导致了更高的成本，也就意味着学生承担的更多债务。
Student  loans  are  often  considered  an  investment in  one's  future. 
学生贷款通常被认为是对未来的投资。
 What  most students forget is that the only way that they can sell this asset is by working off their debt. 
大多数学生忘记的是，他们出售这项资产的唯一方法是偿还债务。
Also, except for possibly MBA students, few people do a discounted cash  flow  analysis  to  verify  that  their  "investment"  actually  has  a  sufficient internal rate of return. 
此外，除了可能的 MBA 学生之外，很少有人会进行贴现现金流分析，来验证他们的“投资”是否有足够的内部收益率。
It's perhaps surprising that many trade schools have higher rates of internal returns than college educations. 
许多贸易学校的内部收益率高于大学教育，这或许令人惊讶。
They cost (much) less, have shorter times to graduation, and due to the overproduction of people with college degrees, the latter no longer bestows as much economic benefit compared to the trades as it used to. 
它们的成本（要低得多），毕业时间更短，而且由于拥有大学学位的人的生产过剩，与过去相比，后者不再提供那么多的经济效益。
Despite this, many young people keep believing that their best shot at a middle-class lifestyle is a college degree, just as the lower class spends almost 10% of their already limited income on lottery tickets to achieve their financial dreams. 
尽管如此，许多年轻人仍然相信，大学学位，是他们实现中产阶级生活方式的最佳选择，正如下层阶级将他们已经有限的收入的近 10%，花在彩票上，以实现他们的财务梦想。
Yes, 10%!
没错，10%！
