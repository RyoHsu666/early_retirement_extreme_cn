A high school diploma used to be sufficient to obtain jobs in most vocations
except  a  few  professions  which  required  advanced  studies,  like  engineering,
science, medicine, accounting, and law. This isn't the case anymore. Today, the
only  way  to  join  the  rank  of  salaried  professionals  is  with  a  college  degree,
despite  the  fact  that  85%  of  college  graduates  eventually  find  jobs  in  a  field
different from the one they graduated in. This is no surprise, as normal office job
functions generally require little knowledge of underwater basket-weaving, 19th
century  Hungarian  clog  art,  or  other  things  of  academic  interest.  A  college
degree has  thus  come  to  serve  as  an  admission  ticket  to  the  white-collar  job
market,  as  employers  deemed  that  the  selective  process  of  getting  through  a
college education is perfect for selecting the most mentally disciplined workers.
Salaried,  white-collar  jobs  are  desirable  because  they're  thought  to  provide
superior  and  stable  pay  and  fringe  benefits.  They're  also  perceived  as  less
strenuous  and  less  dangerous  than  manual  labor.  Today,  there  are  notable
exceptions to this perception. Lifestyle diseases associated with sedentary stress
caused by pushing paper forms around with little autonomy and few tangible
results diminish the health advantages compared to the small chance of having
your arm ripped off in a centrifuge, say. In addition, a skilled machinist or driver
can often make more than a mid-level office worker with equal years of tenure,
and  be  able  to  find  work  anywhere.  A  self-employed  electrician  or  plumber
should be able to clear six figures and set his own hours. Yet young people seem
unaware of this, and thus everybody, even those with no aptitude or desire for
intellectual challenges, try very hard to get into college no matter how it may
impair their future earnings and financial independence.
While the service sector has slowly grown, and as employers have come to
prefer college-educated job applicants, demand for college degrees has gone up.
Colleges and universities have responded by lowering academic standards and
raising their prices, much like other producers of consumer goods and services
respond  to  rising  demand.  This  has  resulted  in  an  overabundance  of  college-
educated  people  with  useless  degrees.  This  creates  structural  unemployment,
which  is  generally  bad  for  society,  bad  for  the  unemployed,  but  good  for
employers.  Hence,  the  continued  calls  for  more  education,  even  though  it's
sometimes  hard  to  see  the  reason.  For  instance,  it's  not  unusual  to  see  job
advertisements along the lines of, "Must have a Bachelor's Degree and be able to
lift 50lbs," to get a store manager job that would have been held by a high school
graduate a generation ago. Perhaps one will need a PhD just to man the cash
register at a burger franchise one day...hey wait, what?!
As universities keep lowering their standards and thus decreasingly serve as
centers of higher learning, they increasingly function as issuers of credentials,
where  students  have  little  purpose  other  than  trying  to  maximize  their  grade
point  average  once  they  get  in.  Hence,  admissions  standards  become  the
dominant factor. Consequently, universities focus on screening methods, while
students  focus  on  how  to  get  around  them.  Many  resources  are  spent  on  an
endless war of attacks and counter-attacks as students and their parents attempt
various strategies, including hiring highly compensated admissions consultants,
to beat the admissions standards.
Many  parents  realize  that  their  children  will  have  an  advantage  if  the
children  start  building  their  résumé a  little  early,  such  as  in  preschool.  In  an

effort to build credentials as early as possible, parents push their children into
advanced  classes,  expect  high  grades,  and  call  the  children's  teachers  if  they
don't get top grades. Super-parents will put in any amount of effort to ensure
their children's "success." At age three they'll send the kids to day care centers
that command a heavy price to make the children multilingual and continuously
engage them in mentally stimulating activities for eight hours a day. Parents will
gladly relocate to another school district to ensure that their children go to the
best schools. Parents will manage their science fair projects for them, projects
that at the high school level are beginning to look more like undergraduate-level
research projects, complete with outside collaborations. They will pay for tutors
and test prep materials, the latter of which prioritizes cramming for and passing a
test rather than learning the underlying material, and they'll make sure that little
Suzy and Johnny have the correct solutions for their math problems if they can't
figure  them  out  themselves.  Rather  than  being  left  to  figure  out  their  own
playtime,  children  are  pushed  into  highly  structured,  adult-supervised
extracurricular activities which take up most weeknights, to pad the résumé with
the awards and honors they need to make their college applications stand out
amongst the thousands of others who follow the same strategy.
Once inside, the main mission has been successfully accomplished. This is
the end of the journey rather than the beginning. Students just have to pass the
time  during  four  years  of  "edutaining"  lectures  on  arcane  subjects  while
maintaining  their  grade  point  averages like  they  did  in  high  school,  dutifully
cramming a few weeks before the examination date, only to forget most of what
they learned as quickly as they memorized it.
If  you  are  sufficiently  smart  and  ambitious  to  get  into  a  top-ranking
university,  the  value  added  by  the  educational  institution  apparently  doesn't
matter  for  your  future  success.  In  other  words,  top-tier  institutions  don't  add
value to create talent as much as they select or discover it. Thus, if you were
smart and ambitious enough to actually get into an expensive top-tier university,
you don't actually need to go to a top-tier university to succeed in life.8 The
ambitious  and  smart  people  realize  this,  drop  out  and  go  start  their  own
companies.  Those  that  are  merely  smart,  stay,  but  quickly  learn  to  select  a
college degree tailored  to  their  desired  job  or  income-level,  and  to  select  the
courses  with  the  highest  grade-to-effort  level  in  order  to  maximize  what
employers are looking for. I knew several people like that--very boring people--
they never knew anything outside of their textbooks, and two weeks after an
exam, they had forgotten practically all of what they had crammed for. Today,
they're highly successful white-collar workers! The educational system works,
just not according to its stated purpose: to educate.

As students have come to view education as a product, and parents are still
only  a  phone  call  away,  professors  are  "encouraged"9  to  make  education
"edutaining." Students now think that if they don't learn anything, it's a failure of
the teaching process, or the teachers, rather than their own failure to study. After
all,  they  paid  for  it.  It's  not  what  you  can  do,  it's  what  you  can  buy,  which
matters.
With  student  evaluations  now  determining  the  career  path  of  young
professors, and young professors determining the career opportunities of young
students, professors and students have adopted a nonaggression pact: Professors
give entertaining and easy courses in exchange for good evaluations. This way,
professors get tenure so that they can get back to publishing papers and writing
grant  proposals  to  bring  in  grant  money.  Such  "soft  money"  is  sometimes  a
substantial part of their salary, and often the reason they got hired in the first
place and sometimes the only way they get to keep their job. Students get their
degrees,  and  everybody  is  happy--except  those  that  came  to  learn  and  be
challenged, and in many cases went deep into debt for the privilege. It's not so
much the educational growth of the graduates that matters, or the teaching skills
of the professors, as much as it's the image of the school, the imposing campus
buildings, and the habits acquired from several years of following procedures,
executing consistently, meeting deadlines and solving closed-end problems with
limited  degrees  of  freedom,  statistically  quantified  into  a  single  grade  point
average for convenient ranking and quick sorting.
In the grand scheme of things, the functional purpose of universities is thus
to sort students into future vocations rather than the commonly believed purpose
of broadening their horizons in a useful manner. Ask a college graduate when the
last time was that they read a book from one end to the other; the answer may
surprise and depress you. Despite this, it's possible for individual students to get
a  broad  background  in  college.  Smart,  if  not  street-smart,  people  abound.
However, it will come at the cost of a high grade point average, as the student
focuses too much on particular interesting subjects or courses which may not
economically provide the optimal grade point return on student effort.
While college means different things to different people--whether it's a place
for  higher  learning,  a  two-to-four-year  binge  party,  or  simply  a  brand  name
admission  ticket  required  by  the  job  market--the  increasing  demand  for
education  and  resulting  higher  cost  mean  that  many  students  take  on  debt.
Student  loans  are  often  considered  an  investment in  one's  future.  What  most
students forget is that the only way that they can sell this asset is by working off
their debt. Also, except for possibly MBA students, few people do a discounted
cash  flow  analysis  to  verify  that  their  "investment"  actually  has  a  sufficient

internal rate of return. It's perhaps surprising that many trade schools have higher
rates of internal returns than college educations. They cost (much) less, have
shorter times to graduation, and due to the overproduction of people with college
degrees, the latter no longer bestows as much economic benefit compared to the
trades as it used to. Despite this, many young people keep believing that their
best shot at a middle-class lifestyle is a college degree, just as the lower class
spends almost 10% of their already limited income on lottery tickets to achieve
their financial dreams. Yes, 10%!
