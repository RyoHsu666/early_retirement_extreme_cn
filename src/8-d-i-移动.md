It's  generally  realized  that  fitness  involves  some  combination  of  diet  and exercise. 

The  diet  quantity  determines  how  big  the  body  will  be  and  the  diet quality  determines  how  healthy  it'll  be. 

The  exercise  quantity  and  quality determines its function, form, and health. 


To understand how this works, think of the human body as being analogous to  a  car,  with  the  exception  that  the  human  body  over  time  is  able  to  adapt  its size  and  shape  to  external  demands  of  diet  and  exercise  (see  Ergodicity  and destiny). 

It  becomes  what  it  does. 

It  is  what  it  has  done. 

In  other  words,  by looking at someone it is possible to see how much and what they eat and what kind of exercise they do. 

Form follows function.
