The taxman defines a home as a place to sleep and a place to cook, with
bathroom  facilities. 

税务员把家定义为一个能睡觉，能做饭，有浴室的地方。

 This  leaves  wide  room  for  interpretation,69  but  what's
important is not the "rooms" but the utility (see Building blocks) that must be
acquired.  Instead  of  thinking  in  nouns  like  bedroom,  kitchen,  and  bathroom,
think in verbs: sleeping, eating, washing, etc.

这经常被解释称是大房间，但是真正重要的不是“房间”，而是必须能获取的设施（参见[建造模块]()）。不是按照卧室，厨房和浴室这样的名词，而是，睡觉，吃饭，洗漱这样的动词。

Make  a  list  of  activities  (verbs)  that  you  need  to  do--sleeping,  eating,
washing  up--and  what  you  want  to  do--writing,  hiking,  cycling,  entertaining,
working,  skating,  talking,  cooking,  playing,  exercising,  etc. 

做一个活动（动词）列表你需要做的，睡觉，吃饭，洗漱；和你想要做的，写作，徒步，骑车，娱乐，工作，溜冰，谈话，烹调，游戏，锻炼，等等。

 Now  consider
whether  you  do  some  of  these  activities  often  enough  to  have  "in-home"
facilities or whether you're better off outsourcing them.

现在考虑是否“在家里”做某些活动所需要的设施，或者最好可以外包出去。

 Consider this list and
extend it to your general facilities--for example, how long since you last used the
guest room, the bar room, the home cinema room, etc. 

考虑一下这个列表，然后扩展你的通用设施，例如，自从你上次使用会客厅、酒吧间、影院间已经过了多久了。

Consider that some rooms
could  have  multiple  uses  (see  Monouse  and  Multiuse).  

考虑一下一些房间可以有多种用途（参见(单一用途和多用途)[]）。

In  particular,  are  the
facilities  available  nearby  already? 

特别的，这些设施是不是附近就有。

 In  this  case,  there's  really  no  reason  to
duplicate them at home. 

如果是这种情况，那就真的没必要在你的家里复制一份。

For instance, if you're a gym rat and spend six days a
week at the gym, maybe you can shower there and thus don't need elaborate
bathroom facilities at home.

例如，如果你是一个健身耗子，每周花六天在健身房，那你也许可以考虑在那里洗澡，就没必要在家里按浴室。

 If you eat in cafeterias most of the time, maybe you
don't need anything fancier than a microwave and a minirefrigerator for your in-
home kitchen facilities.

如果你大多数时间在咖啡厅吃饭，可能你除了微波炉就不需要任何厨具了。

 Hence, if you currently have rooms and facilities that
mostly  go  unused  or  could  go  unused  with  a  change  of  habit  or  hobby  to
something that requires less stuff on location, yet provides as much enjoyment,
don't include them in your next home

然而，如果你当前的房间或者设施，绝大多数都没用，或者改变习惯后可以没用，尽管它们提供了很大乐趣，下次搬家时不要把它们包含进来。
