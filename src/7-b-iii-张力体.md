Having three goals (or  more)  for  each  module  builds  tensegrity into  your
plans and consequently your life. 

每个模块用三个（或更多）目标来构建你计划的张力体和你后续的生活。

If one goal is pushed away, the other connected
goals instantly pull your life in a slightly different direction. 

如果一个目标被推开，其他的目标连接会立刻将你的生活拉向截然不同的方向。

These goals can be
thought of as back-ups or secondary objectives, but it is better if all goals are
approximately equally balanced in importance. 

这些目标可以被考虑成备份或者次要的，但是如果所有目标都是接近相同重要会更好。

For any given activity, one of the
goals should not dominate the others. 

对于任何被给定的活动，一个目标不应该压倒另一个。

This approach is very different from the
standard advice that encourages you to put all your eggs in the single basket of
your job. 

这种做法和标准的建议，鼓励你把所有的鸡蛋，都放在你工作这一个篮子里，是非常不同的。

Having a single goal makes a person effective, but it also makes him
vulnerable  and  subject  to  discontinuous  changes.  

只有一个目标让人有效率，但是这也会让他遭受和变化失去联系。

Plans  have  to  be  altered
radically or even rewritten completely if this goal fails.

如果这个目标失败了，计划可能会被极端地改写。

Because of its flexibility and adaptability, it is important to realize that the
web of goals strategy essentially is a process-oriented strategy rather that a goal-
oriented  strategy.  

因为它的灵活性和适应性，意识到目标网是非常重要的，这是面向过程的策略，而不是面向目标的策略。

On  the  meta  level,  a  process-oriented  strategy  is  primarily
aimed at living, with goals being accomplished as side effects, whereas a goal-
oriented strategy is aimed at goals, with living as a side effect. 

在多元层面上，一个面向过程的策略主要对准的是生存，目标的完成作为侧面影响，而面向目标的策略对准的是目标，生存是侧面影响。

It's natural that
employers prefer employees of the latter persuasion, as they can just break goals
into smaller goals and hire an employee for each sub-goal. 

雇主倾向雇员后一种想法是很自然的，因为他们可以把大的目标拆机成小的目标，然后雇人来实现这些子目标。

As an individual or a
business, the focus should be on the process rather than sub-goals, lest the long-
term perspective be lost.

作用一个个体或者商业，关注的应该是过程而不是子目标，只是长期的透视能力不能丢失。

This  is  perhaps  easier  to  explain  using  sports  as  an  analogy.  

这用竞技可能更好比喻。

Most  sports
require  several  skills  such  as  strength,  endurance,  agility,  speed,  toughness,
stamina,  power,  analytic  aptitude,  teamwork,  etc. 

大多数竞技要求很多技能例如体力、耐力、灵活、速度、韧性、耐力、力量、分析能力、团队合作等等。

 Here,  training  generally
focuses on at least a few of those skills simultaneously for each training exercise,
whereas the game ultimately requires all skills simultaneously. 

这里，训练通常关注至少几个技能同时训练，因为终极比赛要求同时使出所有技能。

Playing sports
with multiple requirements has at least two benefits. 

竞技比赛中的多重要求至少有两点好处。

First, the more diversified
one's sport is in terms of required skills, the easier it is to play any other sport.

第一，一个人的某种运动要求的技能越多样化，他进行任何运动的时候就更容易。

Second, if one skill is lacking, the other skills can still be built and they can, to a
large extent, compensate for weakness in other areas.

第二，如果一种技能缺失，其他技能仍然能继续发展，到了最大程度后，可以补偿其他部分的弱点。
