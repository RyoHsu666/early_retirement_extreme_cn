Having three goals (or  more)  for  each  module  builds  tensegrity into  your
plans and consequently your life. 

每个模块用三个（或更多）目标来构建你计划的张力体和你后续的生活。

If one goal is pushed away, the other connected
goals instantly pull your life in a slightly different direction. 

如果一个目标被推开，其他的目标连接会立刻将你的生活拉向截然不同的方向。

These goals can be
thought of as back-ups or secondary objectives, but it is better if all goals are
approximately equally balanced in importance. 

这些目标可以被考虑成备份或者次要的，但是如果所有目标都是接近相同重要会更好。

For any given activity, one of the
goals should not dominate the others. This approach is very different from the
standard advice that encourages you to put all your eggs in the single basket of
your job. Having a single goal makes a person effective, but it also makes him
vulnerable  and  subject  to  discontinuous  changes.  Plans  have  to  be  altered
radically or even rewritten completely if this goal fails.
Because of its flexibility and adaptability, it is important to realize that the
web of goals strategy essentially is a process-oriented strategy rather that a goal-
oriented  strategy.  On  the  meta  level,  a  process-oriented  strategy  is  primarily
aimed at living, with goals being accomplished as side effects, whereas a goal-
oriented strategy is aimed at goals, with living as a side effect. It's natural that
employers prefer employees of the latter persuasion, as they can just break goals
into smaller goals and hire an employee for each sub-goal. As an individual or a
business, the focus should be on the process rather than sub-goals, lest the long-
term perspective be lost.
This  is  perhaps  easier  to  explain  using  sports  as  an  analogy.  Most  sports
require  several  skills  such  as  strength,  endurance,  agility,  speed,  toughness,
stamina,  power,  analytic  aptitude,  teamwork,  etc.  Here,  training  generally
focuses on at least a few of those skills simultaneously for each training exercise,
whereas the game ultimately requires all skills simultaneously. Playing sports
with multiple requirements has at least two benefits. First, the more diversified
one's sport is in terms of required skills, the easier it is to play any other sport.
Second, if one skill is lacking, the other skills can still be built and they can, to a
large extent, compensate for weakness in other areas.
