Economic skills are necessary to rationally evaluate and distribute resources, both  personal  and  financial. 
经济技能是合理评估和分配个人和财务资源所必需的。
 Without  economic  skills,  it  is  impossible  to  put  a price  on  value  (value  and  price  are  not  the  same  thing!)  and  this  results  in inefficient  and  less-than-optimal  choices. 
没有经济技能，就不可能为价值定价（价值和价格不是一回事！）这就导致了低效和非最优的选择。
 For  instance,  is  it  better  to  a)  spend time learning a more effective method which will save time in the future b) use the old, slow, but verified method or c) go to work and pay an expert to fix the problem?
例如，a)花时间学习一种更有效的方法，这将在将来节省时间 b)使用旧的、缓慢的、但经过验证的方法，还是 c)去工作并付钱给专家来解决问题？ 
 
  Being  aware  of  one's  values  (see  Emotional),  wants  and  needs,  and  being able to prioritize one's efforts to achieve specific goals is the most efficient and least  expensive  way  to  live  a  good  life. 
意识到自己的价值观（参见[情绪]()）、欲望和需求，并能够优先考虑自己为实现特定目标所做的努力，这是过上美好生活的最有效、最省钱的方式。
 Prioritizing  well  requires  planning  and seeing  the  bigger  picture  to  plan  a  strategy  for  achieving  one's  goals. 
正确地确定优先次序需要规划，和看到更大的图景，以便规划实现目标的战略。
 Here  the big picture includes not only the world as it truly is, but also the world as it can become if specific choices are made, including the results that will not obtain if the specific path is taken. 
在这里，大局不仅包括真实的世界，还包括，如果做出具体选择可能会变成的世界，也包括如果选择了具体的道路将无法获得的结果。

In  addition,  financial  skills  are  important. 
此外，财务技能也很重要。
 In  particular,  they  become increasingly  important  for  anyone  who  accumulates  more  and  more  assets. 
特别是，对于任何积累了越来越多资产的人来说，它们变得越来越重要。
 It's strange how specialists gladly spend a great deal of time perfecting their skills to pursue a five percent raise, while at the same time there is a fatalistic tendency to accept  whatever  investment  strategies  are  currently  fashionable  on  Wall  Street when it comes to generating passive income.30 
 奇怪的是，专家们如何乐于花大量时间来完善自己的技能，以追求5%的加薪，而与此同时，当涉及到创造被动收入时，却有一种宿命论倾向，即接受华尔街目前流行的任何投资策略。
 
 When  investments become  fashionable  (a  result  of  emergent  behavior  of  a system), by definition they no longer offer good returns, even though they have historically  when  only  used  by  a  few  people. 
当投资成为时尚（一个系统的紧急行为的结果）时，根据定义，它们不再提供良好的回报，即使它们在历史上只有少数人使用过。
 Handing  over  responsibility  for one's  savings  does  not  make  sense,  especially  for  anyone  whose  investment income  is  comparable  to  one's  expenses  or  worse,  one's  job  income.31  Such  a person is not just an employee, but an asset manager as well. 
把储蓄的责任交给别人是没有意义的，尤其是对那些投资收入与自己的支出相当，或者更糟糕的是，与自己的工作收入相当的人来说。这样的人不仅是一名雇员，也是一名资产经理。
This person would pay  a  steep  price32  by  outsourcing  this  to  professionals  without  at  least understanding the basics of money management himself. 
这个人将付出高昂的代价，将其外包给专业人士，而自己不了解一点资金管理的基本知识。
In fact, outsourcing is a financial decision that should not be made blindly. 
事实上，外包是一项财务决策，不应盲目做出。
