Economic skills are necessary to rationally evaluate and distribute resources, both  personal  and  financial. 

 Without  economic  skills,  it  is  impossible  to  put  a price  on  value  (value  and  price  are  not  the  same  thing!)  and  this  results  in inefficient  and  less-than-optimal  choices. 

 For  instance,  is  it  better  to  a)  spend time learning a more effective method which will save time in the future b) use the old, slow, but verified method or c) go to work and pay an expert to fix the problem? Being  aware  of  one's  values  (see  Emotional),  wants  and  needs,  and  being able to prioritize one's efforts to achieve specific goals is the most efficient and least  expensive  way  to  live  a  good  life. 

 Prioritizing  well  requires  planning  and seeing  the  bigger  picture  to  plan  a  strategy  for  achieving  one's  goals. 

 Here  the big picture includes not only the world as it truly is, but also the world as it can become if specific choices are made, including the results that will not obtain if the specific path is taken. 

Economic analysis reveals such issues. 

In  addition,  financial  skills  are  important. 

 In  particular,  they  become increasingly  important  for  anyone  who  accumulates  more  and  more  assets. 

 It's strange how specialists gladly spend a great deal of time perfecting their skills to pursue a five percent raise, while at the same time there is a fatalistic tendency to accept  whatever  investment  strategies  are  currently  fashionable  on  Wall  Street when it comes to generating passive income.30 When  investments become  fashionable  (a  result  of  emergent  behavior  of  a system), by definition they no longer offer good returns, even though they have historically  when  only  used  by  a  few  people. 

 Handing  over  responsibility  for one's  savings  does  not  make  sense,  especially  for  anyone  whose  investment income  is  comparable  to  one's  expenses  or  worse,  one's  job  income.31  Such  a person is not just an employee, but an asset manager as well. 

This person would pay  a  steep  price32  by  outsourcing  this  to  professionals  without  at  least understanding the basics of money management himself. 

In fact, outsourcing is a financial decision that should not be made blindly. 

Economic goals for someone aspiring to be a Renaissance man are to understand the difference between price and value.
