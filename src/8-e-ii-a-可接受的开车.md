An  enviable  alternative  is  fixing  up  classic  cars  or  motorcycles,  which  can make costs close to zero. 

This is done by buying a fixer-upper at the lower end of  the  price  range  of  the  depreciation  curve  for  a  given  year,  fixing  it  up,  and selling  it  at  the  upper  end  a  few  years  later,  making  the  holding  cost  close  to zero, or perhaps even positive. 

This way you can achieve transportation as well as  income,  whereas  cycling  and walking  achieve  transportation  and  health. 

Of course, you could do the smart thing and fix up bicycles. 

It doesn't pay as well as auto repair, but you get transportation, money, and health (see A web of goals).
