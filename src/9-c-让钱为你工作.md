Until  I  was  25,  it  never  occurred  to  me  that  money  could  work  for  me.
直到25岁，我才意识到钱能为我工作。
Certainly  I  was  aware  that  money  could  be  invested,  and  in  return  I'd  get  a fraction  of  it  back  each  year  in  the  form  of  interest or  dividends.
当然，我知道钱是可以投资的，作为回报，我每年都会以利息或股息的形式收回一小部分。
What  hadn't occurred  to  me  was  that  this  money  could  reach  a  level  equivalent  to  my expenses  and  that  this  money  could  then  pay  for  things  just  as  well  as  earned income  does.
我没有想到的是，这笔钱可以达到相当于我的开支的水平，然后这笔钱就可以像挣来的收入一样来花。
I  think  many  share  this  same  mental  block,  because  savings accounts are either very small, so the annual payout may pay for a night out on the town, or because savings are cordoned off in retirement accounts where  the payouts  go  right  back  into  savings.
我认为许多人都有同样的心理障碍，因为储蓄账户要么非常小，每年的支出可能只够支付在镇上过夜的费用，要么是因为退休账户中的储蓄被封锁，这些支出会直接回到储蓄中。
This  prevents  people  from  thinking  about capital income,  just  as  taking  income  taxes directly  out  of  earnings  before  the paycheck is received prevents people from thinking about taxes, other than as an abstraction that's out of their control.
这阻止了人们思考资本收入，就像在收到工资之前直接从收入中扣除所得税会阻止人们思考税收，而不是把它们作为一种无法控制的抽象概念。

If  you  decide  to  make  money  work  for  you,  over  time  you'll  become  very familiar  with  the  tax  law,  how  to  get  money  out  of  retirement  accounts  while paying  as  little  penalty  as  possible,  and  how  to  take  care  of  the  principal  and keep the yield sustainable, to the point of being at least competent (see Gauging mastery).
如果你决定让钱为你工作，随着时间的推移，你将非常熟悉税法，如何在尽可能少支付罚金的情况下从退休账户中取出钱，以及如何照顾本金并保持收益的可持续性，达到至少称职的程度（参见[衡量精通]()）。
Again,  individual  plans  will  vary  significantly,  but  the  guiding principles  will  be  quite  similar.
同样，个别计划会有很大差异，但指导原则会非常相似。
The  rest  of  this  chapter  will  therefore  discuss overall principles which should hold for the next 100 years, rather than specific investment plans, which may change within a decade.
因此，本章的其余部分将讨论未来100年应遵循的总体原则，而不是可能在十年内改变的具体投资计划。
