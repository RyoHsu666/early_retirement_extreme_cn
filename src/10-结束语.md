Upon graduating with a PhD in theoretical physics, I worked for five years as a  research  associate  while  saving  around  75%  of  my  net  income  and  then  I retired with enough money to last me the rest of my life. 
在获得理论物理博士学位毕业后，我作为研究助理工作了五年，同时节省了大约75%的净收入，然后我退休了，带着足够的钱度过余生。
I now make my living, if judged by income, as a capitalist, and, if judged by (my lack of) spending, as my  own  personal  cook,  trainer,  carpenter,  electrician,  mechanic,  accountant, financial  advisor,  tailor,  engineer,  etc. 
如果以收入来衡量，我现在以资本家的身份谋生，如果以支出来衡量，我现在以自己的私人厨师、培训师、木匠、电工、机械师、会计师、财务顾问、裁缝、工程师等身份谋生。
My  economic  role  is  to  invest  and indirectly provide the productive factors, like factories, tools, supermarkets, and cash  registers,  that  make  work  possible,  rather  than  the  40-80  hours  a  week  of work  itself. 
我的经济角色是投资并间接提供生产要素，如工厂、工具、超市和收银机，使工作成为可能，而不是每周工作40-80小时。
My  effort  in  that  regard  amounts  to  spending  a  few  hours  every month or so, and otherwise waiting for the money to make its way into my bank account  from  my  investments. 
我在这方面的努力相当于每个月花上几个小时左右，然后等待资金从我的投资进入我的银行账户。
If  those  who  work  for  a  living  knew  how  little time it takes to "make" money this way, they would probably be less willing to accept working 40-80 hours a week for 30-40 years. 
如果那些以工作为生的人知道用这种方式“挣钱”所需的时间是多么少，那么他们可能不太愿意接受30-40年来每周工作40-80小时。
Of course, I needed to save the  money  that  allowed  me  to  become  a  capitalist, but anyone who can hold  a regular job for a handful of years and who has the will to save most of it can do this,  so  maybe  it's  okay  that  I  now  get  to  enjoy  the  rest  of  my  life  without  an alarm clock. 
当然，我需要存钱让我成为一名资本家，但任何人只要能做几年固定的工作，并且有存钱的意愿，就可以做到这一点，所以也许我现在可以在没有闹钟的情况下享受余生了。

What  I  mainly  learned  from  my  formal  education--and  I'd  say,  in  my experience  this  holds  exclusively  for  going  to  grad  school  and  writing  a dissertation--was  that  I  alone  am  responsible  for  and  capable  of  making  my decisions  and  solving  my  problems. 
我从正规教育中学到的——我想说，根据我的经验，这只适用于研究生院和写论文——是我独自自主并有能力做出决定和解决问题。
As  an  undergraduate,  and  even  when studying for my Masters degree, it was always clear that I could get the answer from someone smarter than me if my own attempt failed. 
作为一名本科生，甚至在攻读硕士学位时，如果我自己的尝试失败，我总能从比我更聪明的人那里得到答案。
It was also clear that if I didn't manage to get the correct result, it was no big deal since my work was in a  certain  sense  redundant,  as  it  was  being  duplicated  by  all  my  classmates. 
同样清楚的是，如果我没有得到正确的结果，那也没什么大不了的，因为我的工作在某种意义上是多余的，因为我所有的同学都在重复它。
Furthermore, I was always being told "what" to do and "when" to do it. 
此外，我总是被告知“做什么”和“什么时候”去做。
In that sense,  what  an  institutional  education  resulting  in  a  college  degree  does  is  to facilitate the replacement of your parents with your future boss(es), moving you from being dependent on your parents knowing better to being dependent on an employer knowing better. 
从这个意义上说，获得大学机构教育所起的作用是，促进你未来的老板取代你的父母，让你从依赖更了解你的父母变成依赖一个更了解你的雇主。

Doing the doctorate, which aims for a very different goal--namely to produce independent researchers capable of doing original research--made me realize that the "They" or "Them" that people always mention in the phrase, "They'll think of something," had actually become me. 
攻读博士学位，是为了一个完全不同的目标——名义上是培养能够进行原创研究的独立研究人员——这让我意识到，人们总是在“他们会想些什么”这句话中提到的“他们”或“他们”，实际上已经变成了我。
As a result, I always feel slightly worried when I hear the phrase, "They'll think of something..." This changed my attitude towards problems and solutions and I began to use the same approach that I used for  my  research  job  in  the  rest  of  my  life,  always  trying  to  understand  why something was the way it was, whether it could be different, and if so, how? 
因此，当我听到“他们会想些什么……”这句话时，我总是有点担心这改变了我对问题和解决方案的态度，我开始在生活中使用我在研究工作中使用的方法，总是试图理解为什么事情是这样的，它是否可以不同，如果可以，如何？

Instead  of  adopting  the  standard  moneymanagement  plan  of  saving  15%  in an  index  fund  in  my  retirement  plan  while  getting  in  debt  up  to  my  eyeballs thanks to a "starter home," I started looking into the principles behind the system I  was  living  in. 
我不再采用标准的理财计划，在退休计划中把15%的钱存到指数基金中，同时由于一个“首次置业”而债台高筑，而是开始研究我所生活的体系背后的原理。
I  realized  that  the  standard  option  of  becoming  an  indebted consumer  was  just  one  of  many,  but  that  if  anyone  wanted  different  options, they'd have to take a different and more active approach rather than just asking "what?" and "when?" I would need another plan. 
我意识到，成为负债消费者的标准选择只是众多选择中的一个，但如果任何人想要不同的选择，他们就必须采取不同的、更积极的方式，而不仅仅是问“什么？”“什么时候？”我需要另一个计划。
More accurately, I would need a  strategy,  and  to  make  such  a  strategy,  I  would  need  to  understand  the underlying principles and the world they operated in. 
更准确地说，我需要一个战略，而要制定这样一个战略，我需要了解基本原理和它们运作的世界。
Since there are no career tracks available  for  aspiring  Renaissance  people,  we  necessarily  have  to  work with  the  options  that  are  available  to  us  and  bend  them  to  our  purposes. 
由于没有适合有抱负的文艺复兴人的职业道路，我们必须利用现有的选择，并使其符合我们的目标。
Since everybody  has  different  options  available  to  them,  I  didn't  think  presenting  a specific  plan  would  be  very  helpful,  so  this  is  the  main  reason  for  its  absence. 
因为每个人都有不同的选择，我不认为提出一个具体的计划会很有帮助，所以这是它缺席的主要原因。
My own history doesn't seem to follow a plan, specifically because there was no plan. 
我自己的历史似乎没有计划，特别是因为没有计划。
I was increasing my understanding as I went along; eventually crystallizing it into the philosophy I've written down in this book. 
我在前进的过程中增进了我的理解；最终将其具体化为我写在这本书中的哲学。
Despite not having a plan, I had  an  intuitive  grasp  of  the  strategy  and  guiding  principles,  and  I  quickly learned  most  of  the  tactics  since  these  are  very  similar  to  standard  frugal practice. 
尽管没有计划，但我对战略和指导原则有着直观的理解，而且我很快就学会了大部分策略，因为这些与标准的节俭实践非常相似。
The only thing left to do was to pick the level of effort (extreme) and stay disciplined. 
剩下要做的唯一一件事就是选择努力程度（极端）并保持自律。

I  like  the  goal  I  eventually  reached. 
我喜欢我最终达到的目标。
I  love  not  having  to  work  for  money, which means that not only do I get to set my own hours, something which is also possible for the self-employed, but more importantly, I also get to spend all day doing things that don't necessarily need to be done to meet some income quota to put food on the table, like serving on a board of directors for a nonprofit startup, volunteering my time for bike repair, crewing in yacht races, etc. 
我喜欢不必为钱工作，这意味着我不仅可以设定自己的工作时间，这对个体经营者来说也是可能的，更重要的是，我还可以整天做不该做的事情，不一定需要完成一些收入配额才能将食物摆在桌面上，比如在一家非营利性初创公司的董事会任职，自愿花时间修理自行车，参加游艇比赛等等。
Nor do I expect to remain  interested in the  same subjects  all  my life  or that  I'll  follow  a  career track someone else laid out for me. 
我也不希望一辈子都对同样的科目感兴趣，也不希望我会追随别人为我安排的职业轨迹。

My withdrawal rate is very  conservative, so  my  stream of  money will very likely never run out. 
我的提款率非常保守，所以我的资金流很可能永远不会用完。
In fact, simply by doing nothing I'm more likely to end up with more than $1 million in net worth when I reach traditional retirement age, which is much more than what most consumers will manage to save. 
事实上，如果我什么都不做，当我达到传统退休年龄时，我更有可能最终拥有超过100万美元的净资产，这远远超过大多数消费者设法储蓄的金额。
I'm set for life and I can do whatever I want, whenever I want, within reason, as long as I don't  fall  into  any  consumer  traps. 
我已经为生活做好了准备，我可以做任何我想做的事，只要我不落入任何消费者陷阱，我就可以在合理的范围内，在任何时候做任何我想做的事。
Having  about  20  diversified  streams  of income from different investments, I never worry about being unemployed and not having a job. 
我从不同的投资中获得了大约20种不同的收入来源，我从不担心失业和没有工作。
Yet many are afraid of diversified investment income, despite having  their  job  as  their  sole  source  of  income,  and  by  implication,  their  only source of food, shelter, and so on. 
然而，许多人害怕多样化的投资收入，尽管他们的工作是他们唯一的收入来源，也就是说，他们唯一的食物、住所等来源。
The only reason that relying on just one job for money  isn't  considered  risky is  because  it's  a  normal  way  of  life,  and  most have  gotten  used  to  it  or  at  least  accept  it  much  like  they  accept  the  risk  of driving bumper to bumper at 55mph on the freeway, despite the real possibility of the driver ahead of them suddenly losing control for whatever reason. 
仅仅依靠一份工作赚钱没有风险的唯一原因是因为，这是一种正常的生活方式，大多数人已经习惯了，或者至少接受了，就像他们接受在高速公路上以90公里每小时的速度紧跟前车的风险一样，尽管前面的司机可能会因为任何原因突然失去控制。
If more people  spent  five  years  saving  money  and  learning  how  to  live  efficiently  on their  investments  instead  of  spending  five years to  become  plumbers  or MBAs and  zero  years  on  living  efficiently,  and  therefore  working  for  the  rest  of  their lives, financial freedom might not seem so scary. 
如果更多的人花五年时间存钱，学习如何通过投资高效地生活，而不是花五年时间成为水管工或MBA，花零年时间高效地生活，在余生一直工作，那么经济自由可能就不会那么可怕了。
For those who are still unsure, consider that the worst thing that can happen to me, compared to someone who works for a living, is that I have to go back to work and do what they have been doing all along. 
对于那些还不犹豫的人，我认为最糟糕的事情是，工作为了谋生，我必须回去工作，做他们一直在做的事情。
Yet if the market falls sufficiently to cause me to struggle, most people  will  have  lost  their  retirement  savings  as  well  and  we  would  be  in  an economic situation with at least 30% unemployment. 
然而，如果市场下跌到足以让我陷入困境，大多数人也将失去他们的退休储蓄，我们的经济状况将处于至少30%的失业率。
Relying on a salaried full- time job to make a living therefore does not seem any safer. 
因此，依靠有薪全职工作谋生似乎并不安全。
In such a scenario, who  would  you  consider  more  likely  to  do  well,  a  consumer  who  relies  on shopping  for  all  his  needs  or  someone  living  as  I  do?  When  I  was  younger,  I used to deride the idea of jocks and how being a college athlete certainly didn't contribute  to  education;  now  I  believe  it  does. 
在这种情况下，你认为谁更有可能做得更好，是一个依靠购物来满足所有需求的消费者，还是像我一样生活的人？当我年轻的时候，我常常嘲笑运动员的想法，以及作为一名大学运动员肯定对教育没有贡献； 现在我相信它有贡献。
The  most  important  part  of education is forming  your  character  (see  Ergodicity  and  destiny),  whether  as  a worker, capitalist, leader, or follower, or whether you deal with people--that is, the  social  and  the  political--or  reality. 
教育最重要的部分是塑造你的性格（参见[遍历性和命运]()），无论是作为工人、资本家、领导者还是追随者，或者是否你与人打交道，也就是社会和政治，或者现实。
Participating  in  sports  certainly  builds character. 
参加体育运动当然可以塑造性格。
This is partially or perhaps the exclusive reason so many people take up  marathon  running. 
这可能是许多人参加马拉松比赛部分或唯一的原因。
Passing  exams  or  keeping  up  a  grade  point  average develops  another  kind  of  character  and  this  is  why  businesses  are  interested  in students with good grades; aside from the grades serving as a legal proxy in lieu of  intelligence  tests,  employers  know  that  over-achievers  follow  and  take instruction well. 
通过考试或保持平均绩点可以培养另一种性格，这就是为什么企业对成绩好的学生感兴趣的原因；除了作为代替智力测试的成绩外，雇主知道成绩优异的人会很好地遵循并接受指导。
Indeed, there is a common confusion between an education and a degree. 
事实上，教育和学位之间存在着普遍的混淆。
A degree is something you get at college which can be used as an entry ticket to the white-collar job market. 
学位是你在大学获得的东西，可以用作进入白领就业市场的入场券。
Similarly, a certification is something that can be used as an entry ticket to the blue-collar job market. 
同样，认证可以作为进入蓝领就业市场的入场券。
However, a character transformation  can  be  attained  pretty  much  anywhere,  whether  in  a  classroom, laboratory, job, the Peace Corps, the military, or the swim team. 
然而，角色转变几乎可以在任何地方实现，无论是在教室、实验室、工作、和平队、军队还是游泳队。

In fact, education is very different from training. 
事实上，教育与培训有很大不同。
Training is what you know whereas education is who you are as a person. 
培训是你所知道的，而教育是你作为一个人的身份。
As a result, people receiving the same training can end up with very different educations. 
结果，接受相同培训的人最终可能会接受截然不同的教育。
I do believe there is a certain moral aspect to education. 
我确实相信教育有一定的道德方面的教化。
It forms one's character, good or bad. 
它塑造了一个人的性格，好或坏。
In that sense, education is a form of indoctrination aimed to produce a certain attitude. 
从这个意义上说，教育是一种旨在产生某种态度的灌输形式。
This  means  that  education  works  well  if  it  reinforces  and  polishes  an  existing natural  attitude,  but  it  can  be  a  painful  experience  if  one  is  naturally incompatible  with  the  indoctrination. 
这意味着，如果教育能够强化和完善现有的自然态度，那么教育就会很有效，但如果一个人天生与灌输不相容，这可能是一种痛苦的经历。
This  is  why  I  don't  believe  that  one education fits all. 
这就是为什么我不相信一种教育适合所有人。
Ever notice how many successful business leaders are college dropouts? It did not take them long to realize that college was not helping them to become leaders and entrepreneurs. 
有没有注意到有多少成功的商业领袖是大学辍学生？ 他们很快就意识到大学对他们成为领导者和企业家并没有帮助。
This is because a college education creates followers, or people who are habituated to being handed a bunch of instructions and then delivering a product, from years of practice. 
这是因为大学教育创造了追随者，或者是那些习惯于接受一堆指令然后交付产品的人，这些都是多年练习的结果。
It doesn't matter what the form  of  the  product  is--that  is,  whether  it's  an  essay  or  a  math  problem. 
产品的形式是什么并不重要——无论它是一篇论文还是一道数学题。
The important  parts  are  the  assignments,  the  deadlines,  the  grades  and  the  annual reviews; a structure that is repeated at the employee level in corporations. 
重要的部分是作业、截止日期、成绩和年度审查； 在公司员工级别重复的结构。
I have found that I don't make a very happy salary man--I should probably have gotten a clue  from the  fact that  I  was  taking courses based  on personal  interest  rather than strategically choosing the easy courses to optimize my grade point average- -but I have, however, found that I make for a very happy Renaissance man. 
我发现我不是一个非常快乐的薪水人——我本应该从这样一个事实中得到线索，那就是我是基于个人兴趣，而不是策略性地选择简单的课程来优化我的平均分数的——但是我发现我是一个非常快乐的文艺复兴人。
Like me, you may have gotten an education that wasn't compatible with your training. 
和我一样，你可能接受的教育与你的培训不一致。
It may be that you don't know your type like I didn't know mine. 
也许你不了解你的类型，就像我不了解我的类型一样。
Many confuse who they are with what they do! Some get an education for whatever reason and yet are not completely transformed into the intended result, just as children often don't  do  what  their  parents  tell  them  to,  but  rather  become  the  opposite  in  a counterreaction. 
许多人混淆了他们是谁和他们做什么！有些人无论出于何种原因接受了教育，但并没有完全转化为预期的结果，就像孩子们经常不按照父母的要求去做，而是在一种反作用中变成了相反的结果。
So it will be for education. 
教育也是如此。
This book is my contribution to your education.
这本书是我对你们教育的贡献。
