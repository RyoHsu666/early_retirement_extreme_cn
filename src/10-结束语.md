Upon graduating with a PhD in theoretical physics, I worked for five years as a  research  associate  while  saving  around  75%  of  my  net  income  and  then  I retired with enough money to last me the rest of my life. 

I now make my living, if judged by income, as a capitalist, and, if judged by (my lack of) spending, as my  own  personal  cook,  trainer,  carpenter,  electrician,  mechanic,  accountant, financial  advisor,  tailor,  engineer,  etc. 

My  economic  role  is  to  invest  and indirectly provide the productive factors, like factories, tools, supermarkets, and cash  registers,  that  make  work  possible,  rather  than  the  40-80  hours  a  week  of work  itself. 

My  effort  in  that  regard  amounts  to  spending  a  few  hours  every month or so, and otherwise waiting for the money to make its way into my bank account  from  my  investments. 

If  those  who  work  for  a  living  knew  how  little time it takes to "make" money this way, they would probably be less willing to accept working 40-80 hours a week for 30-40 years. 

Of course, I needed to save the  money  that  allowed  me  to  become  a  capitalist, but anyone who can hold  a regular job for a handful of years and who has the will to save most of it can do this,  so  maybe  it's  okay  that  I  now  get  to  enjoy  the  rest  of  my  life  without  an alarm clock. 


What  I  mainly  learned  from  my  formal  education--and  I'd  say,  in  my experience  this  holds  exclusively  for  going  to  grad  school  and  writing  a dissertation--was  that  I  alone  am  responsible  for  and  capable  of  making  my decisions  and  solving  my  problems. 

As  an  undergraduate,  and  even  when studying for my Masters degree, it was always clear that I could get the answer from someone smarter than me if my own attempt failed. 

It was also clear that if I didn't manage to get the correct result, it was no big deal since my work was in a  certain  sense  redundant,  as  it  was  being  duplicated  by  all  my  classmates. 

Furthermore, I was always being told "what" to do and "when" to do it. 

In that sense,  what  an  institutional  education  resulting  in  a  college  degree  does  is  to facilitate the replacement of your parents with your future boss(es), moving you from being dependent on your parents knowing better to being dependent on an employer knowing better. 


Doing the doctorate, which aims for a very different goal--namely to produce independent researchers capable of doing original research--made me realize that the "They" or "Them" that people always mention in the phrase, "They'll think of something," had actually become me. 

As a result, I always feel slightly worried when I hear the phrase, "They'll think of something..." This changed my attitude towards problems and solutions and I began to use the same approach that I used for  my  research  job  in  the  rest  of  my  life,  always  trying  to  understand  why something was the way it was, whether it could be different, and if so, how? 


Instead  of  adopting  the  standard  moneymanagement  plan  of  saving  15%  in an  index  fund  in  my  retirement  plan  while  getting  in  debt  up  to  my  eyeballs thanks to a "starter home," I started looking into the principles behind the system I  was  living  in. 

I  realized  that  the  standard  option  of  becoming  an  indebted consumer  was  just  one  of  many,  but  that  if  anyone  wanted  different  options, they'd have to take a different and more active approach rather than just asking "what?" and "when?" I would need another plan. 

More accurately, I would need a  strategy,  and  to  make  such  a  strategy,  I  would  need  to  understand  the underlying principles and the world they operated in. 

Since there are no career tracks available  for  aspiring  Renaissance  people,  we  necessarily  have  to  work with  the  options  that  are  available  to  us  and  bend  them  to  our  purposes. 

Since everybody  has  different  options  available  to  them,  I  didn't  think  presenting  a specific  plan  would  be  very  helpful,  so  this  is  the  main  reason  for  its  absence. 

My own history doesn't seem to follow a plan, specifically because there was no plan. 

I was increasing my understanding as I went along; eventually crystallizing it into the philosophy I've written down in this book. 

Despite not having a plan, I had  an  intuitive  grasp  of  the  strategy  and  guiding  principles,  and  I  quickly learned  most  of  the  tactics  since  these  are  very  similar  to  standard  frugal practice. 

The only thing left to do was to pick the level of effort (extreme) and stay disciplined. 


I  like  the  goal  I  eventually  reached. 

I  love  not  having  to  work  for  money, which means that not only do I get to set my own hours, something which is also possible for the self-employed, but more importantly, I also get to spend all day doing things that don't necessarily need to be done to meet some income quota to put food on the table, like serving on a board of directors for a nonprofit startup, volunteering my time for bike repair, crewing in yacht races, etc. 

Nor do I expect to remain  interested in the  same subjects  all  my life  or that  I'll  follow  a  career track someone else laid out for me. 


My withdrawal rate is very  conservative, so  my  stream of  money will very likely never run out. 

In fact, simply by doing nothing I'm more likely to end up with more than $1 million in net worth when I reach traditional retirement age, which is much more than what most consumers will manage to save. 

I'm set for life and I can do whatever I want, whenever I want, within reason, as long as I don't  fall  into  any  consumer  traps. 

Having  about  20  diversified  streams  of income from different investments, I never worry about being unemployed and not having a job. 

Yet many are afraid of diversified investment income, despite having  their  job  as  their  sole  source  of  income,  and  by  implication,  their  only source of food, shelter, and so on. 

The only reason that relying on just one job for money  isn't  considered  risky is  because  it's  a  normal  way  of  life,  and  most have  gotten  used  to  it  or  at  least  accept  it  much  like  they  accept  the  risk  of driving bumper to bumper at 55mph on the freeway, despite the real possibility of the driver ahead of them suddenly losing control for whatever reason. 

If more people  spent  five  years  saving  money  and  learning  how  to  live  efficiently  on their  investments  instead  of  spending  five years to  become  plumbers  or MBAs and  zero  years  on  living  efficiently,  and  therefore  working  for  the  rest  of  their lives, financial freedom might not seem so scary. 

For those who are still unsure, consider that the worst thing that can happen to me, compared to someone who works for a living, is that I have to go back to work and do what they have been doing all along. 

Yet if the market falls sufficiently to cause me to struggle, most people  will  have  lost  their  retirement  savings  as  well  and  we  would  be  in  an economic situation with at least 30% unemployment. 

Relying on a salaried full- time job to make a living therefore does not seem any safer. 

In such a scenario, who  would  you  consider  more  likely  to  do  well,  a  consumer  who  relies  on shopping  for  all  his  needs  or  someone  living  as  I  do?  When  I  was  younger,  I used to deride the idea of jocks and how being a college athlete certainly didn't contribute  to  education;  now  I  believe  it  does. 

The  most  important  part  of education is forming  your  character  (see  Ergodicity  and  destiny),  whether  as  a worker, capitalist, leader, or follower, or whether you deal with people--that is, the  social  and  the  political--or  reality. 

Participating  in  sports  certainly  builds character. 

This is partially or perhaps the exclusive reason so many people take up  marathon  running. 

Passing  exams  or  keeping  up  a  grade  point  average develops  another  kind  of  character  and  this  is  why  businesses  are  interested  in students with good grades; aside from the grades serving as a legal proxy in lieu of  intelligence  tests,  employers  know  that  over-achievers  follow  and  take instruction well. 

Indeed, there is a common confusion between an education and a degree. 

A degree is something you get at college which can be used as an entry ticket to the white-collar job market. 

Similarly, a certification is something that can be used as an entry ticket to the blue-collar job market. 

However, a character transformation  can  be  attained  pretty  much  anywhere,  whether  in  a  classroom, laboratory, job, the Peace Corps, the military, or the swim team. 


In fact, education is very different from training. 

Training is what you know whereas education is who you are as a person. 

As a result, people receiving the same training can end up with very different educations. 

I do believe there is a certain moral aspect to education. 

It forms one's character, good or bad. 

In that sense, education is a form of indoctrination aimed to produce a certain attitude. 

This  means  that  education  works  well  if  it  reinforces  and  polishes  an  existing natural  attitude,  but  it  can  be  a  painful  experience  if  one  is  naturally incompatible  with  the  indoctrination. 

This  is  why  I  don't  believe  that  one education fits all. 

Ever notice how many successful business leaders are college dropouts? It did not take them long to realize that college was not helping them to become leaders and entrepreneurs. 

This is because a college education creates followers, or people who are habituated to being handed a bunch of instructions and then delivering a product, from years of practice. 

It doesn't matter what the form  of  the  product  is--that  is,  whether  it's  an  essay  or  a  math  problem. 

The important  parts  are  the  assignments,  the  deadlines,  the  grades  and  the  annual reviews; a structure that is repeated at the employee level in corporations. 

I have found that I don't make a very happy salary man--I should probably have gotten a clue  from the  fact that  I  was  taking courses based  on personal  interest  rather than strategically choosing the easy courses to optimize my grade point average- -but I have, however, found that I make for a very happy Renaissance man. 

Like me, you may have gotten an education that wasn't compatible with your training. 

It may be that you don't know your type like I didn't know mine. 

Many confuse who they are with what they do! Some get an education for whatever reason and yet are not completely transformed into the intended result, just as children often don't  do  what  their  parents  tell  them  to,  but  rather  become  the  opposite  in  a counterreaction. 

So it will be for education. 

This book is my contribution to your education.
