People stuck in their traditional ways of thinking often believe that the path
to freedom and happiness lies in earning a little more money than they currently
earn, 
人们困住他们的传统思维方式里，认为通向自由和幸福的路径是比他们现在多赚点钱，

regardless of how much they earn. 
却不关注他们要赚多少。

However, despite our productivity--and,
hence, our earnings--having doubled compared to two generations ago,
然而，尽管我们的生产力，换句话说，收入，已经比两代人以前翻倍了，

 I doubt
anyone feels freer or happier about their earnings. 
我怀疑没人因为他们的收入感觉更自由或更幸福。

The real problem is not how
much we earn; 
真正的问题不是我们赚了多少，

it's how much we waste, perhaps to demonstrate our supposed
wealth, when we spend it. 
而是我们浪费了多少，当我们花掉它时，用来表明我们假定的富有。

As our productivity has gone up, we've increased the
size of our homes and filled unused rooms with unused purchases, which just
wait  to  be  thrown  out  or  given  away

随着我们生产力的提高，我们增加了房屋的面积，并在未使用的房间里装满了未使用的商品，等待被扔掉或送人。

  We're  surrounded  by  the  inedible
landscapes  of  lawns  and  asphalt

我们被不可食用的草坪和沥青景观所包围。

  We've  moved  far  away  from  work  and  the
market  so  we  can  waste  time  driving  there,  and  money  on  maintaining  our
multiple cars

我们搬到远离工作和市场的地方住，所以我们可以浪费时间开车到那里，并花钱维护我们的多辆汽车。

 In our spare time we waste time watching TV, waste our bodies
eating junk food, then waste money treating the results of those habits

在我们的空闲时间，我们浪费时间看电视，浪费我们的身体吃垃圾食品，然后浪费金钱来治疗这些习惯的结果。

 These
behaviors make no one better off, except those who sell the enabling products,
who, as mentioned above, are often ourselves

这些行为不会让任何人过得更好，除了那些销售支持产品的人，如上所述，他们通常是我们自己。


We  have  counteracted  our  increased  productivity  at  work  with  an
equivalently decreased productivity at home, and consequently we're no better
off  than  before,  except  we  work  much  harder  and  waste  more  resources

我们用在家中同样降低的生产力，抵消了我们在工作中提高的生产力，因此我们的境遇并没有比以前更好，我们只是更努力地工作，并消耗更多资源。

  It
should be clear that we don't make trees grow taller or better by planting more of
them, as long as we keep cutting them down, but this is exactly the philosophy
that is driving our current behavior


应该清楚的是，只要我们不断砍伐树木，我们不会通过种植更多树木，来使树木长得更高或更好，但这正是推动我们当前行为的哲学。

Anyone with access to rich resources has two choices: turn those resources
into waste or turn them into wealth; that is, they can be consumers or producers
(see  Foundations  of  economics  and  finance)

任何拥有丰富资源的人都有两个选择：将这些资源变成废物或将它们变成财富； 也就是说，他们可以是消费者或生产者（见[经济和金融基础]()）。

  What  happened  after
industrialization  took  hold  was  that  a  few  people  became  wealthy,  ruthlessly
eliminating  waste  by  focusing  on  efficiency

工业化后发生的事情是，通过注重效率无情地消除浪费，使少数人致富。

  Many  more  people  started
prodigally wasting the abundance of resources and goods that were suddenly at
their disposal

越来越多的人开始大肆浪费突然可用的大量资源和商品。

 This has now turned into a collaborative/exploitative arrangement,
where a few get wealthy selling waste to the many, while the many are employed
in arrangements in which they have little control over what they produce

现在这已经变成了一种合作/剥削性的安排，少数人通过向多数人出售废物而致富，而许多人则在生产的安排中受雇。

 Often,
their only idea is to work harder and be more productive, or somehow join the
few by finding a clever way to cash in on selling wasteful, low-value products
and services

通常，他们唯一的想法是更加努力地工作并提高生产力，或者以某种方式加入少数人的行列，找到一种巧妙的方式，通过销售浪费的、低价值的产品和服务获利。

As previously remarked, "It is impossible to solve a problem with the same
kind of thinking that created it." Yet this is exactly what we're trying to do again and again

正如前面所说，“用创造问题的同一种思维是不可能解决问题的。” 然而，这正是我们一次又一次做的事情。

  You don't  make  a poorly  designed engine  run  better by  making  it
bigger (or smaller for that matter)

你不会通过让它更大（或更小），来让一个设计糟糕的引擎运行得更好。

 The reason we do so anyway is that we don't
know how to redesign it or that there are too many vested interests who benefit
from not having it redesigned


无论如何，我们这样做的原因是，我们不知道如何重新设计它，或者有太多既得利益者，从维持现状中受益。

Recent years have seen many proposals for such designs

近年来已经看到太多关于此类设计的提案。

 Some designs are
social, requiring everybody to change; some designs are individual, but require
the rest of society to stay the same lest they fail; and some designs, like the one
in this book, work either way and thus remain robust while being immediately
actionable

有些设计是社会性的，需要每个人都改变； 有些设计是个人的，但要求其他社会成员保持不变，以免失败；一些设计，比如本书中的设计，无论哪种方式都可以工作，因此在稳健的同时可以立即行动。

 In the last case the social design will emerge from the widespread
adaption of the individual design, as likely or unlikely as that may be 

最后一种情况，社会设计将从个体设计的广泛适应中出现。

The design presented in the rest of the book rests on three pillars


本书其余部分介绍的设计基于三个支柱。


First,  reduce  waste  and  increase  efficiency

首先，减少浪费，提高效率。

  It's  possible  to  live  with  the
same  benefits  as  the  rest  of  society  for  one  quarter  of  what  the  average
consumer spends

只需花费普通消费者支出的四分之一，就可以享受与社会其他人相同的福利，这是可能的。

 Many of these expenses are eliminated by only owning
what is actually used, and maintaining what is bought

通过只拥有实用的东西，并维护已买的东西，可以消除许多额外的费用。

 If widely adopted,
the  air  will  be  cleaner,  products  will  be  built  for  easy  maintenance,  and
things will last for decades

如果广泛采用，空气将更清洁，产品将易于维护，并且可以使用数十年。

 Many old businesses will shut down but be
replaced by new businesses with a focus on quality and durability

许多老企业将倒闭，取而代之的是注重质量和耐用性的新企业。

 People
will  have  more  time  for  each  other

人们会有更多的时间彼此相处。

  They  will  know  the  names  of  their
neighbors


他们会知道邻居的名字。

Second,  having  significantly  reduced  expenses,  invest  the  difference  in
businesses

第二，减少开支，将差额投资于商业。

 If widely adopted, businesses producing obsolete things which
are no longer in demand will shut down, but new ones will appear, and it's a
lot easier to change investments than it is to change careers

如果这被广泛采用，生产过时产品的企业将关闭，但新产品会出现，改变投资比改变职业容易得多。

 Alternatively,
those  with  greater  control  over  their  income  can  choose  to  work  less  at
higher  efficiencies  and  save  the  money  for  intermittent  periods  without
income

或者，那些对收入有更大控制力的人，可以通过高效率来减少工作，并在没有收入的间歇期存钱。

 This works well for small business owners or contractors, who can
decide to only take on the most profitable work and stop working when
they no longer need money

这对小企业主或小承包商很有利，他们可以决定只承担最有利可图的工作，并在不再需要钱时停止工作。

 It's difficult to run a small-time business and
make  an  average  income,  but  it's  easy  to  make  a  quarter  of  an  average
income through multiple income streams (see A modular design)

经营小型企业并赚取平均收入很困难，但通过多种收入来源，赚取平均收入的四分之一很容易（参见[阅模块化设计]()）。

 It's a lot
safer, too, compared to the risk of losing a single income stream from a job

与失去一份工作的单一收入来源的风险相比，这也更安全。


This is also useful in case the world as we know it ends and businesses and
trade all break down

这在我们所知的世界结束、企业和贸易都崩溃的情况下也很有用。

 This has happened once in recorded history--namely, the Dark Ages, (see Leaving the Dark Ages and Investing and reasonable return rates)  and  being  widely  skilled  (see  Human  capital  and  necessary personal  assets)  is  better  insurance  against  such  an  event  than  being  an expert  in  pushing  buttons  on  an  assembly  line,  or  pushing  papers  or business plans at a desk

这在有记录的历史中曾经发生过一次——即黑暗时代，（参见[离开黑暗时代]()和[投资和合理的回报率]()），并且拥有广泛的技能（参见[人力资本和必要的个人资产]()）是预防这类事件的更好的保险，而不是做一个，在装配线上按按钮，或在办公桌前推商业计划的专家。

Third, find something meaningful to do instead of work

第三，找点有意义的事情做，而不是工作。

 If your work is
really  meaningful  to  you,  you  can  keep  working,  knowing  that  you  are
living a less wasteful existence and that you have the financial security to
leave your job at any time

如果你的工作对你来说真的很有意义，你可以继续工作，因为你知道你的生活不是浪费生命，而且你有经济保障可以随时离职。

 The latter in particular seems to make quite a
difference in terms of what employees are willing to put up with or which
customers business owners are willing to keep around

尤其是后者，在员工愿意忍受什么，或企业主愿意留下哪些客户，这些方面产生了很大的不同。

 Initially, working at
reducing waste will occupy some time, but once the methods are learned,
this won't take longer than the usual method of buying a gadget or hiring a
professional

最初，减少浪费的工作会占用一些时间，但是一旦学会了一些方法，这不会比购买小工具，或聘请专业人士花费更长时间。

 Instead, it's necessary to find something else to occupy your
time  with

相反，有必要找点东西来打发你的时间。

  I  don't  cover  this  in  great  detail,  having  never  lacked  the
imagination to find activities that are meaningful to me

这一点我不会讲地过于详细，因为我从不缺乏想象力，来寻找对我有意义的活动。

 Currently, I spend
my "retirement" volunteering on the board of a small nonprofit, tending our
garden, improving my hockey game, crewing in yacht races, learning how
to  repair  mechanical  watches  and  bicycles,  blogging,  and  writing  books
such as this

目前，在我“退休”期间，我在一家小型非营利组织的董事会做志愿者，照料我们的花园，提高我的曲棍球技艺，参加游艇比赛，学习如何修理机械手表和自行车，写博客，写书，如本书。


These three pillars can all be pursued simultaneously and they can interact
synergistically

这三个支柱可以同时追求，它们也能协同作用。

  Each  reinforces  the  other  two,  but  none  of  them  rely  on  the
others

每个都加强了其他两个，但没有一个依赖于其他一个。

 The money saved from reducing waste can be invested, and the method
leading to savings can be cast as a meaningful activity

减少浪费节省的钱可以投资，节省的方法可以作为有意义的活动。

 Conversely, meaningful
activities  can  often  provide  income  in  a  way  that  reduces  waste

相反，有意义的活动通常会以，减少浪费的方式提供收入。

  In  addition,
savings allows one to invest in better quality--for example, paying eight times as
much for something that lasts ten times longer, instead of being stuck with a
low-end model that only serves to increase waste and money losses

此外，储蓄允许人们投资于更好的质量——例如，为延长十倍时间的东西，支付八倍的费用，而不是停留在只会增加浪费和金钱损失的低端模式。
