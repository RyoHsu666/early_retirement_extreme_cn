People stuck in their traditional ways of thinking often believe that the path
to freedom and happiness lies in earning a little more money than they currently
earn, 
人们困住他们的传统思维方式里，认为通向自由和幸福的路径是比他们现在多赚点钱，

regardless of how much they earn. 
却不关注他们要赚多少。

However, despite our productivity--and,
hence, our earnings--having doubled compared to two generations ago,
然而，尽管我们的生产力，换句话说，收入，已经比两代人以前翻倍了，

 I doubt
anyone feels freer or happier about their earnings. 
我怀疑没人因为他们的收入感觉更自由或更幸福。

The real problem is not how
much we earn; 
真正的问题不是我们赚了多少，

it's how much we waste, perhaps to demonstrate our supposed
wealth, when we spend it. 
而是我们浪费了多少，当我们花掉它时，用来表明我们假定的富有。

As our productivity has gone up, we've increased the
size of our homes and filled unused rooms with unused purchases, which just
wait  to  be  thrown  out  or  given  away.  We're  surrounded  by  the  inedible
landscapes  of  lawns  and  asphalt.  We've  moved  far  away  from  work  and  the
market  so  we  can  waste  time  driving  there,  and  money  on  maintaining  our
multiple cars. In our spare time we waste time watching TV, waste our bodies
eating junk food, then waste money treating the results of those habits. These
behaviors make no one better off, except those who sell the enabling products,
who, as mentioned above, are often ourselves.
We  have  counteracted  our  increased  productivity  at  work  with  an
equivalently decreased productivity at home, and consequently we're no better
off  than  before,  except  we  work  much  harder  and  waste  more  resources.  It
should be clear that we don't make trees grow taller or better by planting more of
them, as long as we keep cutting them down, but this is exactly the philosophy
that is driving our current behavior.
Anyone with access to rich resources has two choices: turn those resources
into waste or turn them into wealth; that is, they can be consumers or producers
(see  Foundations  of  economics  and  finance).  What  happened  after
industrialization  took  hold  was  that  a  few  people  became  wealthy,  ruthlessly
eliminating  waste  by  focusing  on  efficiency.  Many  more  people  started
prodigally wasting the abundance of resources and goods that were suddenly at
their disposal. This has now turned into a collaborative/exploitative arrangement,
where a few get wealthy selling waste to the many, while the many are employed
in arrangements in which they have little control over what they produce. Often,
their only idea is to work harder and be more productive, or somehow join the
few by finding a clever way to cash in on selling wasteful, low-value products
and services.
As previously remarked, "It is impossible to solve a problem with the same
kind of thinking that created it." Yet this is exactly what we're trying to do again

and again.  You don't  make  a poorly  designed engine  run  better by  making  it
bigger (or smaller for that matter). The reason we do so anyway is that we don't
know how to redesign it or that there are too many vested interests who benefit
from not having it redesigned.
Recent years have seen many proposals for such designs. Some designs are
social, requiring everybody to change; some designs are individual, but require
the rest of society to stay the same lest they fail; and some designs, like the one
in this book, work either way and thus remain robust while being immediately
actionable. In the last case the social design will emerge from the widespread
adaption of the individual design, as likely or unlikely as that may be.
The design presented in the rest of the book rests on three pillars.

First,  reduce  waste  and  increase  efficiency.  It's  possible  to  live  with  the
same  benefits  as  the  rest  of  society  for  one  quarter  of  what  the  average
consumer spends. Many of these expenses are eliminated by only owning
what is actually used, and maintaining what is bought. If widely adopted,
the  air  will  be  cleaner,  products  will  be  built  for  easy  maintenance,  and
things will last for decades. Many old businesses will shut down but be
replaced by new businesses with a focus on quality and durability. People
will  have  more  time  for  each  other.  They  will  know  the  names  of  their
neighbors.
Second,  having  significantly  reduced  expenses,  invest  the  difference  in
businesses. If widely adopted, businesses producing obsolete things which
are no longer in demand will shut down, but new ones will appear, and it's a
lot easier to change investments than it is to change careers. Alternatively,
those  with  greater  control  over  their  income  can  choose  to  work  less  at
higher  efficiencies  and  save  the  money  for  intermittent  periods  without
income. This works well for small business owners or contractors, who can
decide to only take on the most profitable work and stop working when
they no longer need money. It's difficult to run a small-time business and
make  an  average  income,  but  it's  easy  to  make  a  quarter  of  an  average
income through multiple income streams (see A modular design). It's a lot
safer, too, compared to the risk of losing a single income stream from a job.
This is also useful in case the world as we know it ends and businesses and
trade all break down. This has happened once in recorded history--namely,
the Dark Ages, (see Leaving the Dark Ages and Investing and reasonable
return rates)  and  being  widely  skilled  (see  Human  capital  and  necessary
personal  assets)  is  better  insurance  against  such  an  event  than  being  an
expert  in  pushing  buttons  on  an  assembly  line,  or  pushing  papers  or
business plans at a desk.
Third, find something meaningful to do instead of work. If your work is
really  meaningful  to  you,  you  can  keep  working,  knowing  that  you  are
living a less wasteful existence and that you have the financial security to
leave your job at any time. The latter in particular seems to make quite a
difference in terms of what employees are willing to put up with or which
customers business owners are willing to keep around. Initially, working at
reducing waste will occupy some time, but once the methods are learned,
this won't take longer than the usual method of buying a gadget or hiring a
professional. Instead, it's necessary to find something else to occupy your
time  with.  I  don't  cover  this  in  great  detail,  having  never  lacked  the
imagination to find activities that are meaningful to me. Currently, I spend
my "retirement" volunteering on the board of a small nonprofit, tending our
garden, improving my hockey game, crewing in yacht races, learning how
to  repair  mechanical  watches  and  bicycles,  blogging,  and  writing  books
such as this.
These three pillars can all be pursued simultaneously and they can interact
synergistically.  Each  reinforces  the  other  two,  but  none  of  them  rely  on  the
others. The money saved from reducing waste can be invested, and the method
leading to savings can be cast as a meaningful activity. Conversely, meaningful
activities  can  often  provide  income  in  a  way  that  reduces  waste.  In  addition,
savings allows one to invest in better quality--for example, paying eight times as
much for something that lasts ten times longer, instead of being stuck with a
low-end model that only serves to increase waste and money losses.
