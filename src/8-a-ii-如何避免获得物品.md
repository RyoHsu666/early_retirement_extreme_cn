It is very likely that you already have very many things; I know I did. 
很可能你已经拥有了很多东西；我知道我是这样。
The most  important  thing,  therefore,  is  to  avoid  getting  more  things  and compounding the problem.

The wish list method seems to be widely known. 
愿望清单法似乎广为人知。
It's trivially easy to use and I  have  been  using  it  for  a  long  time,  first  with  actual  pen  and  paper,  later  just mentally. 
它非常容易使用，我已经使用它很长时间了，首先是用实际的笔和纸，后来只是在思想上。
Here's how it works: Instead of buying when I develop a spontaneous desire to purchase something, I put it on my wish list along with the date of the wish. 
它是这样运作的：当我自发地想要买东西的时候，我把它和愿望的日期一起放在我的愿望清单上，而不是买东西。
Don't buy anything unless it has been on the wish list for at least 30 days. 
不要买任何东西，除非它已经在愿望清单上至少30天了。
You will likely find that you have either found an alternative to buying it in the meantime, perhaps by finding an alternative or by learning how to do without it. 
你可能会发现，在这段时间里，你要么购买了它的替代品，要么找到了替代品，要么学会了如何不用它。

Books  used  to  be  my  favorite  consumer  item. 
书籍曾经是我最喜欢的消费品。
I  read  several books a week. 
我每周读几本书。
During a time when I had no access to libraries and  was  buying sufficient number of books to make my landlady inquire about the large number of deliveries I was receiving, I decided to go without books. 
有一段时间，我无法进入图书馆，买了太多的书，以至于我的房东太太询问我，这么多快递是怎么回事，我决定不买书。
I went from buying close  to  100  books  a  year--about  30  times  the  average  person--to  buying  three books in total over the course of a year--about the same amount as the average person. 
我从一年买近100本书——大约是普通人的30倍——到一年内总共买了三本书——大约和普通人一样多。
That  was  not  fun!  However,  books  aren't  very  expensive,  so  I  decided that one book a month would be enough to satisfy my cravings, when combined with  a  newly  developed  interest  in  geopolitics  which  could  be  satisfied  by reading news online.60 The lesson was that there was an optimal point which is slightly less than the extreme point. 
那可不好玩！然而，书不是很贵，所以我决定一个月一本书就足以满足我的欲望，再加上对地缘政治的新兴趣，这可以通过在线阅读新闻来满足。经验教训是，有一个小于极值点的最佳点。
Most people will still consider the optimal point  extreme,  but  that's  because  they've  never  experienced  the  extreme. 
大多数人仍然会考虑最佳点极端，但这是因为他们从未经历过极端。
