Culturally  speaking,  we  have  been  programmed  to  believe  that  an  empty feeling  in  the  stomach  is  undesirable  and  a  full  belly  is  good. 
从文化角度讲，我们已经习惯于相信胃空是不可取的，肚子饱是好的。
However, throughout  and  before  history,  warriors  and  pre-farmers--that  is,  hunter- gatherers--have followed a diet of eating almost nothing during the day followed by a large meal at night after the fight, or hunt, as it may be. 
然而，在整个历史和之前，战士和前农民——也就是狩猎采集者——都遵循一种饮食习惯，白天几乎不吃东西，然后在战斗或狩猎后的晚上吃大餐。
This is called The Warrior Diet as developed by Ori Hofmekler and it prevents insulin levels from spiking more than once a day, and even better, instead of trying to plan and fit in three or six meals a day, it only requires the planning of a single meal. 
这就是Ori Hofmekler开发的勇士饮食，它可以防止胰岛素水平一天上升不止一次，甚至更好的是，它不需要一天计划三餐或六餐，只需要一顿饭。
There is no tracking of calories as one develops a natural feel for being full without being bloated,  and  if  prioritizing  foods  with  a  strong  thermic  effect  by  eating  those first, it is hard to eat enough to gain weight with a single meal. 
没有对卡路里的追踪，因为一个人会自然而然地感到饱而不会撑着，如果先吃那些有强烈热效应的食物，一餐就很难吃到足够多的食物让体重增加。

In  terms  of  exertion,  modern  workers,  like  managers,  assistants,  and  desk jockeys,  and  modern  warriors  like  soldiers,  policemen,  and  firefighters,  have more in common with the historical warrior or hunter-gatherer than the farmer or the athlete. 
就体力而言，现代工人，如经理、助手和桌面骑师，以及现代战士，如士兵、警察和消防员，与历史上的战士或狩猎采集者相比，与农民或运动员有更多的共同点。
It would thus make sense to eat similarly. 
因此，吃同样的食物是有道理的。
Imagine being called out to a fire just before one of the six small meals on the bodybuilder diet or just after one the three bigger meals on the farmer diet--exerting yourself on full stomach is not a pleasant experience! 
想象一下，在“健美饮食”的六顿小餐中的一顿之前，或者在“农民饮食”的三顿大餐中的一顿之后，你被召唤到火中——吃饱的肚子并不是一种愉快的体验！

Like switching to cold showers, changing the timing of one's meals takes a couple  of  weeks  for  the  body  to  adapt  to;  especially  if  it's  used  to  increasing insulin  levels  in  anticipation  of  food  at  certain  times  of  the  day. 
就像换成冷水澡一样，改变一个人吃饭的时间需要几周的时间让身体适应；尤其是当它习惯于在一天中的特定时间增加胰岛素水平，并期待着食物时。
If  food  is  not forthcoming,  the  presence  of  insulin  will  drop  the  blood  sugar  below  a comfortable  level  and  cause  the  sensation  of  hunger. 
如果没有食物，胰岛素的存在会将血糖降至舒适水平以下，并引起饥饿感。
Being  hungry  is  nothing particularly worrisome unless it becomes a permanent condition; unfortunately, well-fed people are unused to this feeling, and it's therefore a serious barrier to overcome. 
饥饿没有什么特别令人担忧的，除非它成为一种永久性的疾病；不幸的是，吃得饱的人不习惯这种感觉，因此这是一个需要克服的严重障碍。
After a couple weeks of getting used to not eating at a particular time, the feeling will  go away. 
在习惯于在特定时间不吃东西的两周后，这种感觉就会消失。
If dinner is  eaten at a regular time,  one  will still feel hungry if that meal is missed or delayed.
如果晚餐是在固定时间吃的，如果错过或延迟，你仍然会感到饥饿。
