Culturally  speaking,  we  have  been  programmed  to  believe  that  an  empty feeling  in  the  stomach  is  undesirable  and  a  full  belly  is  good

However, throughout  and  before  history,  warriors  and  pre-farmers--that  is,  hunter- gatherers--have followed a diet of eating almost nothing during the day followed by a large meal at night after the fight, or hunt, as it may be

This is called The Warrior Diet as developed by Ori Hofmekler and it prevents insulin levels from spiking more than once a day, and even better, instead of trying to plan and fit in three or six meals a day, it only requires the planning of a single meal

There is no tracking of calories as one develops a natural feel for being full without being bloated,  and  if  prioritizing  foods  with  a  strong  thermic  effect  by  eating  those first, it is hard to eat enough to gain weight with a single meal

In  terms  of  exertion,  modern  workers,  like  managers,  assistants,  and  desk jockeys,  and  modern  warriors  like  soldiers,  policemen,  and  firefighters,  have more in common with the historical warrior or hunter-gatherer than the farmer or the athlete

It would thus make sense to eat similarly

Imagine being called out to a fire just before one of the six small meals on the bodybuilder diet or just after one the three bigger meals on the farmer diet--exerting yourself on full stomach is not a pleasant experience! Like switching to cold showers, changing the timing of one's meals takes a couple  of  weeks  for  the  body  to  adapt  to;  especially  if  it's  used  to  increasing insulin  levels  in  anticipation  of  food  at  certain  times  of  the  day

If  food  is  not forthcoming,  the  presence  of  insulin  will  drop  the  blood  sugar  below  a comfortable  level  and  cause  the  sensation  of  hunger

Being  hungry  is  nothing particularly worrisome unless it becomes a permanent condition; unfortunately, well-fed people are unused to this feeling, and it's therefore a serious barrier to overcome

After a couple weeks of getting used to not eating at a particular time, the feeling will  go away

If dinner is  eaten at a regular time,  one  will still feel hungry if that meal is missed or delayed.
