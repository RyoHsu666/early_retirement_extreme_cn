Let's  divide  the  income  stream  from  working  into  spending  on  wants, spending on needs, and saving.
让我们把工作收入分成欲望支出、需求支出和储蓄。
For example, a typically recommended savings rate for  the  average  consumer  is  10%.
例如，一般建议普通消费者的储蓄率为10%。
The  division  between  needs  and  wants depends on personal circumstances.
需求和欲望的区分取决于个人情况。
Most need far less than they think, but let us assume that 60% is spent on needs and 30% is spent on wants.
大多数人的需求远低于他们的想象，但让我们假设60%用于需求，30%用于欲望。
As a general rule, emergency funds only need to replace needs.
一般来说，应急资金只需满足需求。
With the numbers given above, it thus takes 6 months to build an emergency fund that will supply all needs for 1 month.
根据上面的数字，满足1个月的所有需求的应急基金需要6个月时间。
If the emergency (lack of job income) lasts more than 1 month, one will be wiped out and start to default.
如果紧急情况（缺少工作收入）持续超过1个月，应急基金将被清空，并开始违约。
If an emergency is expected to last 6 months, one thus needs 6 times as much money.
如果紧急情况预计持续6个月，那么就需要6倍的资金。
With the 10% savings rate it will take 6×6  months,  or  3  years  to  build  this  fund.
在10%的储蓄率下，建立该基金需要6×6个月或3年的时间。
If  emergencies  happen  more frequently, which isn't completely unlikely, then one will be wiped out because there is not enough time to rebuild the emergency fund.
如果紧急情况发生得更频繁，这并非完全不可能，那么其中一个将被清空，因为没有足够的时间重建应急基金。

Consider another example for someone with the same savings rate, 10%, but here only 20% is spent on needs while 70% is spent on wants.
另一个例子是储蓄率相同的人，10%，但是这里只有20%的人花在需求上，而70%的人花在欲望上。
In this case it only takes  2  months  of  savings  to  replace  1  month  of  spending  on  needs.
在这种情况下，只需要2个月的储蓄就可以取代1个月的需求支出。
If  the emergency  fund  is  for  the  same  duration  (6  months),  the  time  it  takes  to  fully fund  the  emergency  fund  is  1  year  instead  of  the  3  years  in  the  first  example.
如果应急基金的期限相同（6个月），则为应急基金提供全额资金所需的时间为1年，而不是第一个示例中的3年。
This  means  that  for  the  same  savings  rate,  a  budget  dominated  by  flexible (loosely coupled) wants is more resilient than a budget dominated by inflexible (tightly coupled) needs.
这意味着，对于相同的储蓄率，由灵活（松散耦合）需求主导的预算比由不灵活（紧密耦合）需求主导的预算更有弹性。

Now consider a third example.
现在考虑一个第三个例子。
Here the savings rate is 20%, needs are 20% and  wants  are  60%.
这里的储蓄率是20%，需求是20%，欲望是60%。
Here  it  takes  1  month  of  savings  to  replace  1  month  of spending on needs.
在这里，1个月的储蓄能填补1个月的需求支出。
To create the 6 month emergency fund only takes half a year.
建立6个月的应急基金只需要半年时间。
This is the safest distribution of spending and saving of the three examples.
这是三个例子中最安全的支出和储蓄分配。
But one can do better, as will be shown below.
但我们可以做得更好，这将会在下面展示。

The conclusion here is that the higher the ratio of savings rate to needs, the safer one is from emergencies.
这里的结论是，储蓄率与需求的比率越高，紧急情况下的储蓄就越安全。
Also, the higher the ratio of wants to needs (more wants, fewer needs), the safer the person is.
此外，欲望与需求的比率越高（欲望多，需求少），人就越安全。
It should now be easy to calculate the  size  of  an  emergency  fund.
现在，计算应急基金的规模应该很容易。
All  you  need  is  to  identify  your  needs  relative your income, your savings relative to your income, and the expected duration of your emergency (how long it will take to find a new job--this depends on your profession  and  the  economy).
你所需要的只是确定你的需求相对于你的收入，你的储蓄相对于你的收入，以及你的紧急情况的预期持续时间（找到一份新工作需要多长时间——这取决于你的职业和经济状况）。
You  also  need  to  estimate  the  frequency  of  your emergencies (how often you expect to get laid off).
你还需要估计紧急情况发生的频率（你预计被解雇的频率）。
