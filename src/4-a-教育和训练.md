Children naturally try to emulate their parents, at least in the early years,

and
for the most part a child's values are a direct reflection of his parents', 

并且，孩子的大部分价值观是他们父母价值观的直接反应，

either
conformingly  aligned  or  diametrically  opposed.  

要么完全接近，要么完全相反。

Traditionally,  parents  have
played  a  large  role  in  their  children's  upbringing.

However,

households now require two incomes, 

现在家庭需要两份收入，

and thus, as it so often goes in our time, 

因此，就像我们日常生活经常运转的那样，


parents have outsourced their  children's
upbringing and, possibly taking a lesson from their own situation as wage slaves,
they now act as managers of their children's lives and careers rather than as role
models, signing them up for extracurricular activities that are so very important
for their résumé to get into their dream college.

父母将孩子的养育职责外包了出去，并且很可能将他们薪资奴隶的状态教给了孩子，他们现在扮演的是管理者，而不是他们应有的角色，指定孩子的特定活动，这对于他们孩子就可以在申请梦想大学时，有一个漂亮的简历。

 What happened to spending all
day kicking a rock around or catching frogs in the creek?

将一整天的时间，花在把石头到处踢和在池塘抓青蛙，又会怎么样呢？

 For that matter, what
happened to the frogs?7

对这个问题（更重要的可能是），青蛙们会怎么样？

Fortunately, most of the skills necessary for success as a consumer and wage
slave  are  taught  in  the  institutions  of  the  public  school  system.  

幸运的是，大多数成为成功的消费者和薪资奴隶的技能，都是在公立教育系统中教授的。

It's  not  the
subjects that are taught so much as it's the way they're taught.

这不是他们教授的目标，而是他们教授的方式。

 During children's
typical  12-year  stint  in  the  public  school  system,  the  most  "successful"  (read
well-adjusted) learn not to question authority, not to ask questions which don't
pertain to the task at hand, to follow procedure, that trying is better than doing,
to be a team player, and not to stand out.

在孩子12岁的时候在公立学校系统里，最“成功”（为了阅读好看而调整成这个词）的就是学习不要质疑权威，不询问那些并不适用的任务，跟随着流程，成为一个团队成员，并且不要出头。

 Most importantly, children are trained
to  sit  still  for  increasingly  longer  time  spans  while  doing  mentally  menial
busywork.

最重要的是，孩子们被训练安静地坐着，不断增加时间，去完成那些精神奴仆的忙碌工作。

 During recess children learn the importance of being well-liked and
fitting  in--that  is,  being  unique  and  special  within  a  certain  restricted  range.


在休息时，孩子们学习行为良好的重要性——被人喜欢和融入群体，也就是在一个严格限定的范围内，成为一个唯一而独特的人。

These  are  the  essentials  for  later  success  on  the  job. 

这对将来工作上的成功是必要的。

 If  it  wasn't  for  this
behavioral training, the limited subject matter that is actually taught could be
accomplished much more quickly.

如果不是这种行为训练，那么那些受限的课题事实上可以非常快的完成。

 However, imagine what would happen if 12-
year-olds with the same intellectual power as high school students, but without
the acquired discipline and dulled creativity to sit still and follow boring work
procedures for extended periods, suddenly flooded the job market. 

然而，如果那些12岁年纪的孩子和高中生具有相同的智能，但是没有那些安静坐着，遵循那些无聊的工作流程，会发生什么，就业市场立刻就会受到冲击。

Would they
even want a job?
The mass education in high schools reflects the mass production of the real
world.

谁还想要工作？大量的高中教育，反应到真实世界就是大量的生产。

 The teaching style has one teacher (supervisor) lecturing (leading) 20-25
students  (workers)  sitting  in  rows,  much  like  a  manager  and  his  employees.

教育模式就是，一个老师（监工）讲授（领导）20~25个学生（工人），坐成一排，和管理员和他们的雇员是一样的。

Practically  all  problems  that  are  presented  are  closed-form  problems  where
there's only one answer that, by construction, can be found using the methods in
the textbook. 

所有给出的，封闭式的，只有一个答案的问题，通过解释，能被从书本里找到解法。

The subjects taught are selected to be testable, preferably using
standardized exams with predefined answers. 

这些被教授的主题，都是经过筛选可以考试的，非常适合适，使用预定的答案进行标准的考试。

This means that most subjects are
mechanical  rather  than  organic  in  nature,  in  the  sense  that  they  have  a  well-
defined  problem  with  an  easy,  step-by-step  method  of  arriving  at  a  solution,
rather than an open-ended problem with nonlinear and complex solutions. 

这意味着，大多数主题是机械的，而不是自然的，他们都是良好定义的，从简到难，寻求答案的方法，而不是开放式的问题，有非线性和复杂的解法。

There
is therefore an advantage to focusing on memorizing the textbook rather than
attaining  a  broader  understanding. 

这样，记忆书本上的东西占优先地位，而不是获得更广泛的理解。

 This  is  excellent  training  for  intelligently
following  procedure,  but  also  a  powerful  counter-training  against  using
intelligence creatively.

对于智力遵循流程，这是一个完美的训练，但是，对于使用创造性智力却是强大的反训练。

The testing structure is fairly simple. 

测试结构都相当简单。

Some chapter in the book will have a
paragraph which reads, "There are three known instances of..." while the test
will have a question, "Name the three instances of..." 

一些书中的章节有这样的段落，“这里有三个已知的示例……”，然后，测试的题目是，“三个已知的示例的名字是……”

This is not much different
from a job, where there are three kinds of burgers for sale and the cash register
has three pictures of burgers (press the correct one), 

这并不比工作难多少，有三种代售的汉堡，收款机上有三种汉堡的图片（按下正确的一个），

or three kinds of situations
with three different forms to fill out one for each.

或者三种不同的情况，用三种不同的形式填进去。

 This kind of education doesn't
instill  much  permanent  information,  and  it  doesn't  require  much  deep
understanding of the fundamentals. 

这种教育没有灌输一些永久性的信息，也不需要对公式有很深的理解。

It doesn't instill knowledge and it certainly
doesn't instill wisdom--in that sense, I guess it's much like the news media. What
it mostly does is to test the students' intelligence and short-term memorization
skills, and their willingness to use these talents to maximize their test scores and
grades.

它不灌输知识，并且它确实不灌输智慧，从某种意义上，我猜它更像是新闻媒体。它真正做的就是测试学生的智力和短期记忆能力，和他们使用他们才能最大化测试分数的意愿。

 It's fortunate that most office jobs don't require much prior knowledge
from  the  job  applicant. 

这是幸运的，因为绝大多数办公室工作并不要求很高的知识层次。

 The  procedures  for  most  jobs  can  be  learned  by  a
sufficiently  intelligent  person  with  a  sufficiently  good  memory  and  the
conditioning to concentrate on the same task for long hours. 

绝大多数工作流程被，一个足够聪明、又有良好记忆的人、又能长时间关注相同任务的人学习。

Many employers,
however,  don't  hire  people  without  the  required  proof  of  achievement  and
conformity--that is, a degree.

很多雇主，然而，不会雇佣没有证明的人——那就，学历。


Meanwhile,  many  subjects  that  could  be  taught  in  school  are  not.  

与此同时，很多需要在学校里被教的东西却没有教。

It's
probably safe to say that adolescent children growing up in a "primitive" tribe
understand the world around them by the time they reach adulthood. They know
which plants are safe and which are poisonous. They can hunt and cook and they
know the real nutritional value of various foods.

可以肯定地说，在“原始”部落中长大的青春期儿童，在他们成年时了解他们周围的世界。他们知道哪些植物是安全的，哪些是有毒的。他们可以打猎和做饭，他们了解各种食物的真正营养价值。

 They can clothe themselves.
They know how to fix and even build a house. They know about sex and having
children.

他们可以自己做衣服。他们知道如何修理甚至盖房子。他们知道性和拥有孩子。

On the other hand, people in our "advanced" civilization know practically
nothing about our world.

另一方面，我们“先进的”文明中的人们实际上并不了解我们的世界。

 Despite being wholly dependent on technology for all
our needs, few understand how technology provides us with light, heat, food,
communication, transportation, etc. 

尽管所有人都完全依赖技术解决我们所有的需求，很少有人了解技术如何为我们提供光、热、食物、通讯、交通等。

All we know is how to turn on the ignition
and  press  a  button  so  technology  magically  performs  its  intended  function.

我们只知道如何打开点火开关，按下一个按钮，让技术神奇地执行其预期功能。

Despite their "education," students are still left to magical thinking and are thus
unable  to  understand  the  direct  causes  in  the  world  around  them. 

尽管他们接受了“教育”，但学生们仍然被留在神奇的思维中，因此无法理解他们周围世界。

 Specific
functions are thus associated with specific (brand name) products rather than the
operating ingredients and construction of the product.

具体的功能与特定（品牌名称）产品相关联，而不是与产品的操作成分和结构。

 It would never occur to
them that the majority of their collection of 20 different and highly advertised
cleaning products could all be replaced with the vinegar and baking soda which
people used to use. 

他们永远不会想到，他们的大部分收藏品包括20种不同的、广为宣传的清洁产品，都可以用人们曾经使用过的醋和小苏打代替。

It would never occur to them to chop garlic with a knife
instead of using one of the many different designs of garlic press.
This  product-oriented  thinking  extends  to  health. 

他们永远不会想到，用刀切大蒜，而不是使用各式各样的压蒜器，这种以产品为导向的思维延伸到了健康领域。

 The  connection  between
lifestyle and health has been lost. The focus has moved from a healthy lifestyle
to affordable health insurance, making health a product rather than a state of
being.

生活方式和健康之间的联系已经丧失。焦点已从健康的生活方式，转移到负担得起的健康保险，使健康成为一种产品而不是一种状态。

 Cardiovascular problems resulting from stress and lack of exercise can be
solved by purchasing triple-bypass operations and popping specialized aspirins.

压力和缺乏运动导致的心血管问题，可能是通过购买三重旁路手术，和弹出专门的阿司匹林来解决。

People have heart attacks because they don't see the connection to their stressful,
unhealthy lifestyles, and people die from heart attacks despite being surrounded
by bystanders because practically none of them knows CPR or basic first aid.

人们心脏病发作，是因为他们没有看到它与压力、不健康的生活方式的联系，人们被旁观者包围死于心脏病，因为几乎没有人知道心肺复苏术或基本的急救。

Critical  thinking  has  been  replaced  by  opinions  derived  from  pundits  and
political and religious leaders since people prefer having other people think for
them.

批判性思维已被权威人士、政治和宗教领袖的观点所取代，因为人们更喜欢让其他人代替他们思考。

 World affairs are replaced with celebrity reporting, and satirical news is
often more analytical than real news.

世界大事被名人报道取代，讽刺新闻通常比真实新闻更具分析性。

In  conclusion,  after  "growing  up,"  the  only  thing  children  know  is  that
problems are solved by buying products; that in order to buy something, one
needs a job; and in order to get a job, one needs a college degree, which happens
to be considered a brand name product as well.

总之，在“长大”之后，孩子们唯一知道的就是，通过购买产品解决问题；为了买东西，一个人需要一份工作；为了找到一份工作，一个人需要大学学位，这恰好也被认为是一种品牌产品。
