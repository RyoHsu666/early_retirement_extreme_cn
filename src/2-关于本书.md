I think of this book first and foremost as a philosophy book about strategy.
我认为首先本书是一个关于策略的哲学书籍。

Like most philosophical books, it's voluminous compared to its content because
much of it is dedicated to (re)defining underlying concepts and fundamentals,

像许多哲学书籍一样，它使用大量的篇幅重新定义了一些基本概念，

trying to find the words to describe something that isn't automatically implied by
the usual understanding1 of the words used. 
尝试找到文字去描述一些平常不会用这些文字自动去描述的东西。

The lack of concrete specifics is
intentional  because  they  won't  pertain  to  very  many  people.  
缺少详细的说明是有意的，因为他们不会适合大多数人。

The  approach  is
deliberately open-ended to make the concepts applicable to as many different
situations as possible. 

途径是有意的开放式，使概念适用于尽可能多的适应不同情况。

This may also mean that the concepts, which aim to create
consilient and resilient structures, are applicable to other kinds of organizing like
policy-making or business management.

这也可能意味着旨在创造一些有一致性和弹性结构的概念，使他们适用于其他类型的组织，如
政策制定或商业管理。


This  book  isn't  a  "how-to"  manual  to  a  specific  lifestyle,  but  a  "how-to"
manual for "how-to" manuals. The intention is for each person to create his own
strategy.  

这本书不是特定生活方式“怎么做”的手册，而是一个“怎么做”手册的“怎么做”手册。
这么做的目的是让每个人都能创造一个属于他自己的方案。

In  this  sense,  this  book  isn't  a  travel  journal,  nor  is  it  a  set  of  map
directions;  it's  a  book  that  teaches  you  to  become  a  navigator.  I  used  the
principles in this book to reduce my expenses to a quarter of the average person
and  become  financially  independent  in  five  years.  While  my  story  may  be
entertaining or inspiring, it may not be directly useful towards reaching a similar
goal. Similarly, while initially motivating due to their actionable form, a set of
map directions would fail the first time one reaches a crossroads not on the map.
This  would  end  the  journey  if  the  "pilot"  has  no  navigational  skills.  I  have
therefore written the book as a textbook. Learning how to become financially
independent requires study. This requires effort and is not easy--if it was truly
easy,  everybody  would  be  doing  it--but  it's  no  more  difficult  than  getting  a
college education or becoming a skilled tradesman in your respective field. What
I'll describe here is another kind of life, the life of an independently wealthy and
widely skilled person--a modern Renaissance man.



## A note about the difficulty level

This isn't a book for beginners. It's not a book one can pick up, read, and
proceed  to  become  financially  independent  just  as  reading  a  textbook  about
physics  won't  turn  a  person  into  a  physicist.  This  only  happens  when  the
concepts are constantly applied and one starts "thinking like a physicist." Things
are similar for a person pursuing financial independence.
This  is  a  book  which  I  think  can  be  read  at  several  different  levels.  The
reason  for  different  levels  is  that  people  change  as  they  learn.  Depending  on
where  you  are,  the  book  will  relate  to  you  in  different  ways.  This  is  good,
because those who evolve will become different people, eventually. What used
to seem like a sacrifice will seem natural, and what used to seem natural will
come to be seen as a sacrifice. What used to be a collection of techniques will
become a general principle. What used to feel challenging will now feel easy.


## A note about getting started

You don't need to learn everything before getting started. After all, you can
drive a car without knowing how the engine works. In fact, you can drive several
different kinds of cars. This is because most cars handle the same. However, to
stay  with  the  analogy,  the  same  car  can  be  driven  with  very  different  gas
mileages. It may be listed as 33mpg, but good technique can double that number
and poor technique can cut it in half. A trivial technique is to reduce speed by
5mph, which will simply bring most drivers back to the speed limit. Similarly, if
living is thought of as driving a particular kind of "vehicle," there are techniques
in this book which can be applied without understanding exactly why they work.
Understanding  why  they  work  will  subsequently  allow  one  to  tweak  and
improve them.


## A note about references

This is not an academic work. I have resisted the temptation to follow the
medievally inspired academic tradition of citing old books to make statements
based on authority.2 I find that showing the derivation from basic principles is
more  useful  for  application.  Instead  of  references,  I  have  provided  a
bibliography of books in the appendix of this book, each of which will add to the
subject.


## A note about geography
While this book is somewhat US-centric in its examples, the methods should
work in any developed country with a market economy. Retirement plans have
different names from country to country, but every country offers very similar
plans to its citizens. In some countries health care is paid through taxes, and in
other  countries  it's  paid  out  of  pocket.  In  any  case  the  prices  for  goods  and
services  are  similar  in  developed  countries  so  the  strategies  in  this  book  will
work, even if technical details differ


## A note about originality

Feynman  once  remarked  that  the  best  way  to  find  new  insights  into  a
problem was to step out of the box, ignore previous publications, and come to
your own conclusions. With such an approach, it often happens that a concept
which  is  initially  considered  to  be  novel  turns  out  to  have  been  discovered
already.  In  fact,  many  of  the  ideas  in  this  book  go  back  decades  and  even
centuries.
To give an example, when I was a teenager, I wasted a lot of my time playing
computer games. One genre I particularly enjoyed was real-time strategy: games
like Dune, Warcraft I and II, and Command and Conquer. In these games you
build up forces comprised of individual units (tanks, warriors, etc.). When these
units fight, each fights at full strength until it's destroyed or killed. Since the rate
of attrition depends on the number of weapons firing or striking, the optimal
strategy in a battle is therefore for all your units to attack a single individual
enemy at a time to reduce the number of enemies firing or striking as fast as
possible. A great many players have independently "discovered" this strategy,
called Lanchester's Square Law, without being aware that it had actually already
been discovered by Frederick W. Lanchester during World War I. So it is with
many observations about life in general. This incidentally is why reading the
classics  is  very  worthwhile--concepts  get  discovered,  forgotten,  and  then
rediscovered, either independently or by reading old books. Like Lanchester's
Law, I discovered many of the concepts in this book only to find out later that
someone else had already discovered and named the concept before me. Further
reading revealed that yet others had written about the concept before them, and
so on.3 Analogously, I'm sure that Lanchester wasn't the first person to think
about how to most effectively direct the fire of siege trebuchets


## A note about completeness

There's  always  the  temptation  to  make  a  book  complete.  However,  a  line
must be drawn lest the book grow to the size of a minor encyclopedia. After all,
the quantity of knowledge that must be mastered is not trivial, and thus I can't
describe  everything.  However,  I  hope  I've  used  enough  relevant  keywords  to
allow  a  quick  search  on  the  Internet  for  more  information.  In  all  cases  I've
striven to use standard words rather than jargon.
