Americans spend close to half of their food budget having professionals cook for them. 

This is the equivalent of a third of my entire budget--not just for food; for everything. 

The solution is to dial down restaurant visits to the point where they again become special and exciting rather than expected. 

For those who eat out  for  social  reasons,  instead  of  meeting  at  a  restaurant,  take  turns  meeting  at each  other's  homes. 

Either  take  turns  cooking  for  each  other  or  make  every gathering  a  potluck. 

If  you're  really  enterprising,  start  a  "club"  with  your neighbors,  each  taking  a  turn  cooking. 

With  seven  families,  you  only  have  to cook once a week.
