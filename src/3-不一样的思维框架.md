When I grew up, I dutifully went to school and did my homework. 
在我成长中，我一直尽职的上学和完成作业。
For the most part, schooling was about sitting still for 45 minutes while doing simple tasks that the teacher handed out. 
大多数时候，学校就是安静地坐45分钟，同时完成老师的任务。
I was very good at sitting still and thus I was a good student.
我很擅长老实儿地坐着，所以我是个好学生。
I learned how to add, multiply, divide, and subtract. 
我学着怎么加减乘除。
I learned how to punctuate a sentence and how to spell.
我学着怎么发音和拼写。
I learned something about chemistry.
我学了一些化学知识。
Then I learned something about physics and geology.
接着我又学了一些关于物理和地质的东西。
At some point, the teacher introduced tests and grades. 
到了一些时间点，老师指导着考试和升学。
Test-taking became the primary objective; 
接受考试是主要的目标，
learning secondary. 
学习，次要的。
We had the option to quickly forget what we had spent the past year learning  after  the  test  was  done.  
考试完成，我们很快就忘了我们花几年时间所学的东西。
In  other  words,  we  were  being  taught  to  be
"flexible." 
换句话说，我们被教会了要“灵活”。
Later, there were job fairs and educational fairs telling us how to write résumés and how to interview so we could get jobs.
之后，工作市场和教育市场教我们如何写简历，如何面试，然后我们才能得到工作。

Yet, I never learned why the world worked the way it did, and in retrospect, I
 think nobody ever even asked the question. 
然而，我从没学到这个世界为什么像这样运转，回想起来，我认为也没人曾经问过同样的问题。
Everybody always only focused on the  "what"  and  "where;" 
每个人永远只关注“什么”和“哪里”
no  questions  asked.  
没有质疑。
But  as  I  started  my  career as  a research assistant in physics, 
但是当我作为一个物理研究助理，开始我的的职业生涯后，
I started getting interested in all the "whys" of life.
我开始对生活中所有的“为啥”感兴趣了。
As I studied and thought about various fundamental questions such as, "Why do we use money instead of promises or favors?"; 
我研究和思考了一堆基础性的问题，比如“为啥我们用钱而不是承诺或者人情？”；
"Why do we live in houses and not boats or cars?"; 
“为啥我们住房子里而不是在船里或车里？”；
"Why are there usually 2-4 people in a home and not 10-
20?"; 
“为啥我们一个房子里住2-4个人而不是10-20个？”；
"Why do we move away from home?"; 
“为啥我们要从家里搬出去？”；

"Why do we work until we're 65?"
“为啥我们要工作到65岁？”；
-
-all while getting assaulted with well-intended "encouragements" 
-同时被善意的“鼓励”攻击 着。
that I should make sure to open a retirement account before I was 30 and put 15% of net income into it; 
我应该确保在我 30 岁之前开设一个退休账户，并将净收入的 15% 存入其中；
that I should buy a house; 
我应该买个房子；
that married homeowners were more prosperous and therefore I better get married too; 
已婚房主更富裕，因此我最好也结婚；
that I should buy a new car;
我应该买个新车；
that people would like me more if I wore a particular kind of brand clothing, 
如果我穿某种品牌的衣服，人们会更喜欢我，
and that I would enjoy a beverage more if it came from a certain kind of bottle. 
我会更喜欢喝来自某种瓶子的饮料。
I was beginning to feel that something was wrong. 
我开始觉得事情有些不对劲。
"Why is the emperor not wearing any clothes?" I started getting an uneasy feeling that something about the world was not quite right.
“皇帝怎么没穿衣服？” 我开始对世界上不太对劲的事情感到不安。
Nobody explained the "why." 
没有人解释“为什么”。
Sure, they could explain how I should first purchase a "starter home," so I could "upgrade" later.
当然，他们可以解释我应该如何首购买“入门之家”，以便我以后可以“升级”。
But nobody could or would explain why I should buy a house in the first place.
但是没有人能解释为什么我应该首先买房子。
Nobody could or would explain why I should have a career, only that career development was important 
没有人能够或会解释为什么我应该从事职业，只有职业发展很重要。 

There  are  a  few  allegories  that  explain  this  progression  in  thinking.
有一些寓言可以解释这种思维进程。
The oldest is Plato's Cave.
最古老的是柏拉图洞穴。
4 In Plato's Cave prisoners have been arranged in a row in a  dark  cave  since  childhood.
在柏拉图的洞穴里，囚犯们从小就被安排在一个黑暗的洞穴里。
They're  chained  so  that  they  can't  move  their bodies, and their heads are restrained too so they can only face forward, towards a wall.
他们被铁链锁住，身体无法移动，他们的头也被束缚住，只能面朝前方，面对墙壁。
They can hear and speak but they can't see each other, nor can they see themselves.
他们可以听到和说话，但他们看不到对方，也看不到自己。
Behind  them  is  a  fire.
他们的身后是一团火。
The  fire's  light  shows  the  shadows  of  the prisoners on the wall.
火光映出墙上囚犯的影子。
Between the prisoners and the fire there are people and animals  acting  out  a  realistic  play  casting  shadows  on  the  wall  as  well.
在囚犯和火之间，还有人和动物在表演逼真的戏剧，在墙上投下影子。
The prisoners see only the shadows, but they hear all the sounds.
囚犯们只看到影子，但他们能听到所有的声音。
Naturally they think the  world  is  composed  of  shadows  on  the  wall  and  that  they  themselves  are shadows  on  the  wall.
自然而然地，他们认为世界是由墙上的影子组成的，而他们自己也是墙上的影子。
The  shadows  talk  to  each  other  and  interact,  and  it  all makes sense to the prisoners, who think that all the shadows on the wall are like themselves.
影子互相交谈、互动，这对囚犯来说都是有道理的，他们认为墙上的所有影子都像他们自己。
The prisoners even know each other through the shadows they see and the voices they hear, and they gain status by their ability to  recognize other shadows and predict what they'll do.
囚犯们甚至通过他们看到的影子，和听到的声音相互认识，他们通过识别其他影子，和预测他们会做什么的能力来获得地位。
Now, imagine that one of the prisoners is released.
现在，想象一下其中一名囚犯被释放。
His shackles fall to the ground and he can turn his head.
他的枷锁掉在地上，他可以转动他的头了。
He sees the other prisoners sitting in a row chained to the ground and he's horrified.
他看到其他囚犯排成一排，被锁在地上，他吓坏了。
He also sees the actors and animals between the prisoners and the fire.
他还看到了囚犯和火团之间的演员和动物。
He sees the cave opening and ventures out.
他看到洞穴打开并冒险出去。
He is blinded by the light, but finally sees the big picture: All his life he has been sitting in a cave, chained to the ground, believing that the wall was it.
他被阳光晃地眩目，但终于看到了更大的图景：他一生都坐在山洞里，被铁链锁在地上，相信墙就是整个世界。
Now he has realized that the action on the wall is guided mainly by a few actors, with the prisoners providing commentary.
现在他意识到墙上的动作主要由几个演员引导的，与此同时囚犯提供评述。
Now he sees the opportunities in the real world.
现在他看到了现实世界中的机会。
He feels duty-bound to go back and inform the prisoners of the situation and try to release them.
他觉得有责任回去告诉其他囚犯真实情况，并试图释放他们。
First he tries to explain the existence of the puppet-masters to the prisoners, but the masters are unlikely to corroborate his story since they derive much personal benefit from the current way of the world.
首先，他试图向囚犯解释傀儡大师的存在，但大师们不太可能证实他的故事，因为他们正以此从当前的世界获得了很多利益。
Then he tries to explain how the system is arranged with the prisoners and the cave.
然后他试图解释系统是如何使用洞穴安排囚犯的。
Tragically, he finds the prisoners more resistant than he expected.
可悲的是，他发现囚犯比他预期的更抗拒。
Most don't believe him--and why should they? Having adjusted to the light outside, he can't see the shadows as clearly as they can.
大多数人不相信他——他们为什么要相信？ 适应了外面的光线后，他没法和他们一样看清影子。
"What a dimwit."
“真是个傻子。”

Taking off the chains requires too much effort, so most of them remain seated.
摘下锁链太费劲，所以大部分人还坐在原地。
These are people who are very good and successful at identifying, naming, and dealing with shadows, and so they may not want to leave.
还有些人非常擅长识别、命名和处理阴影，因此他们可能不想离开。

There are also those who do feel the need to leave.
也有人觉得有必要离开。
Leaving is not easy; it requires much learning and a reorientation of one's values from equating success with identifying shadows to equating success with moving around in the real world.
离开并不容易；它需要大量的学习和重新定位一个人的价值观，从将成功等同于识别阴影，转移到将成功等同于在现实世界中走动。

In  real  life,  the  prisoners  of  Plato's  Cave  are  those  who  are  prisoners  or slaves to their wages and their culture.
在现实生活中，柏拉图洞穴的囚犯，是那些被他们的工资和文化所俘虏或奴隶的人们。
A wage slave is a wage earner who is entirely  dependent  on  their  wages.
薪资奴隶是完全依赖工资的工薪阶层。
While  the  wage  slave  is  free  to  leave  the current job, he isn't free to leave the job market altogether and he can likely not imagine the possibility of doing so.
虽然薪资奴隶可以自由地离开当前的工作，但他不能完全离开就业市场，而且他可能无法想象这样做的可能性。
He is still entirely focused on the wall.
他仍然将全部注意力放在墙上。

The wall shows other people not as who they are, but as what they own.
这面墙向其他人展示的不是他们是谁，而是他们拥有啥。
There goes a man in his new sports car--what is not seen is that the car is bought on credit and that the man is stressed because he is having trouble making the payments.
有一个人开着他的新跑车——没有看到的是这辆车是贷款买的，而且这个人因为偿付困难而倍感压力。

Wage slaves have jobs where they can go and spend their most productive hours writing high-powered memos so they can be more productive, while other people spend their time ignoring memos so they can be more productive too.
薪资奴隶有工作，他们可以花他们最有效率的时间来写高效的备忘录，这样他们就可以更高效，而其他人则把时间花在忽略备忘录上，这样他们也可以更高效。
This is how it goes.
这就是这一切如何运转的。
In fact, one of the great inventions of the 20th century, the personal computer, has made it possible to write even more memos and notices.
事实上，个人计算机是20世纪的伟大发明之一，它让编写更多的备忘录和通知成为可能。
This is great because it allows people to do their job while looking busier than ever.
这很好，因为它让人们可以在完成工作时，看起来比以往任何时候都更忙了。
Looking busy is important because in this culture business is a virtue, just as being in debt is a virtue, and the most virtuous are those with the highest credit scores.
看起来很忙很重要，因为在这种文化中，忙是一种美德，就像负债是一种美德，而最具美德的是那些信用评分最高的人。
They're  better  at  being  in  debt  compared  to  other  people.
与其他人相比，他们更擅长负债。
This endless working and paying is called "making a living," yet people are so busy "making a living" that they have no time for living.
这种无休止的工作和付出叫做“谋生”，而人们却忙着“谋生”到没有时间生活。
A wage slave is a person who is not only economically bound by mortgages, loans, and other obligations, but also mentally bound by an inability to perceive that there are other options available, like the prisoners in Plato's Cave.
薪资奴隶不仅在经济上受到抵押、贷款和其他义务的束缚，而且在精神上也受到无法感知其他选择的束缚，就像柏拉图洞穴中的囚犯。
Their chains are not physical like those of 150 years ago (though they still are in some parts of the world); the chains are mental, which in some sense makes them worse, because it turns the prisoners into their own prison wardens.
他们的锁链不像 150 年前那样是有形的了（尽管它们仍然存在于世界的某些地方）； 锁链是精神上的，这在某种意义上使他们变得更坏，因为它把囚犯变成了自己的监狱看守。
Like the slaves in Plato's Cave, the only commonly accepted way for one of them to leave is to win the "prison game," which means accumulating at least a million to retire.5
就像柏拉图洞穴中的奴隶一样，离开的唯一普遍接受的方式就是赢得“监狱游戏”，这意味着积累至少一百万才能退休。

The disenchanted grumble about "the system" or "the man." The analogy of "the system" is the people walking around behind the chained slaves, keeping them going.
对“系统”或“那些人”的失望的抱怨不断。“系统”是比喻那些在奴隶后面走来走去的人，他们让奴隶们继续前进。
However, it's mainly the slaves themselves who keep themselve going.
然而，真正让奴隶们继续的，是奴隶自己。
We don't realize that we maintain this system by lack of imagination and questioning.
我们没有意识到，我们是通过缺乏想象力和怀疑精神，在维护着这个系统的。
Like birds, which never seem to have a flight plan, yet always seem to  fly  together  in  a  swarming  flock,  we  don't  question.
就像鸟儿，它们似乎从来没有飞行计划，总是成群结队地一起飞，我们也一样，从不怀疑。
We  obediently  pick whatever options are handed to us, often choosing based on what our neighbors have  chosen.
我们顺从地接过交给我们的任何选项，通常根据周围人的选择进行选择。
We  make  the  best  of  the  shadows  on  the  wall,  but  we  do  not question the wall.
我们尽最大可能利用墙上的阴影，但我们不质疑这面墙。
The best prison is the one with invisible bars.
最好的监狱是有隐形栏杆的监狱。

Perhaps  one  reason  for  this  complacency  is  the  large  quantity  of  material goods  available  to  the  chain  gang.
这种完备性的一个可能原因是，锁链制造团伙可以获得大量的物资。
Material  goods  are  often  used  as compensation.
物质货物通常用作补偿。
Frequently, when someone is depressed, the advice is "Go out and spend  some  money.   Buy  yourself  something  nice.   Treat  yourself. Try  a  little retail therapy. "  People  don't  seem  to  realize  that  this  attempt  to  feel  good  is exactly  what  propagates  the  problem.
通常，当有人沮丧时，建议是“出去花点钱。给自己买点好东西。善待自己。尝试一点零售疗法。”人们似乎没有意识到，这种感觉良好的尝试正是传播的问题。
Compared  to  people  just  50  years  ago, modern wage slaves live a life of material abundance.
与 50 年前的人们相比，现代工资奴隶过着物质丰富的生活。
They're consumers.
他们是消费者。
They have  big-screen  TVs,  movies  on  demand,  microwave  ovens,  food  processors, and 24-piece flatware.
他们有大屏幕电视、电影点播、微波炉、食品加工器和24件套餐具。

They redecorate, attend sporting events, go on vacations, and occasionally play with their toys.

Society has made it very easy to spend money.
这社会让花钱变得很容易。
Shopping centers line every street.
每条街都有购物中心。
Many creative means of spending money have been devised.
已经设计了许多创造性的花钱方式。

使用传统的开罐器，打开一罐西红柿需要30秒，现在可以花30分钟的时间来购买一个，可以在相同时间内打开罐头的电动开罐器。
Similarly, many of the ways we used  to  do  things  have  been  redesigned  to  ensure  that  instead  of  doing  it ourselves, we can buy some gadget or some service to have it done for us.
同样，我们过去做事的方式都经过重新设计，以确保我们可以购买一些小工具或服务来帮我们完成，而不用自己做。
This is  convenient,  because  we're  usually  too  busy  working  to  pay  for  it  to  do  it ourselves.
这是很方便，因为我们忙于工作给这些便利付钱，而没时间自己去做。
This is the gist of the service economy; presumably, if we didn't create enough problems to spend time solving them, the economy would collapse.
这就是服务经济的要旨；据推测，如果我们不创造足够多的问题，然后花时间去解决它们，经济就会崩溃。

To  speed  up  consumption,  it's  possible  to  obtain  loans  and  spend  money that's yet to be earned.

It usually starts with toys for the children and quickly evolves to cell phones and fashionable clothes.
它通常从儿童玩具开始，并迅速演变为手机和时髦的衣服。
Many realize that demonstrating their personal values through the color and build of their cell phone is perhaps inadequate and then move on to bigger and more expensive propositions like large cars, redecorating, or kitchen renovating.
许多人意识到通过手机的颜色和构造，来展示他们的个人价值观是不够的，然后就转向了更大、更昂贵的设施，如大型汽车、重新装修或翻新厨房。
Not that there's anything wrong with such creative outlets, but the scale of these "projects" is often mind-boggling, with tens of thousands being spent on marginal increases in functionality.
并不是说这种创意渠道有什么问题，但这些“项目”的规模往往令人难以置信，数以万计的资金用于增加边际功能。
The old but typically fully functioning items are discarded, especially if they have those ugly 1970s earth tone colors, or that bland 1980s beige, or whatever we had in the 1990s, etc.
通常功能齐全的旧物品被丢弃，特别是，如果它们具有 1970 年代丑陋的大地色调，或者 1980 年代的淡米色，或者我们在 1990 年代拥有的任何颜色，等等。

It goes somewhere, typically a landfill.
它会去某个地方，通常是垃圾填埋场。
Now multiply that by several hundred million people--not cool! In the same vein, tally up the sum total of your earned income so far, subtract your savings, and compare the difference to your pile of stuff.
现在乘以几亿人——一点都不酷！ 以同样的方式，计算到目前为止您的总收入，减去您的储蓄，然后将差值与你的一堆东西进行比较。
Was it really a good deal? 
真的很划算吗？

Is spending the most productive years of your life chained to the job market to collect a lot of rarely used stuff that gathers dust in the closet or takes up space in junkyards a wise choice? Were you really born just to die, leaving a large pile of discarded consumer goods? Probably not.
将你生命中最富有创造的几年和就业市场绑定到一起，收集大量很少使用的东西，这些东西会在壁橱里积灰或占用垃圾场的空间，这是一个明智的选择吗？ 你真的是为了从死到生，留下一大堆废弃的消费品吗？可能不是。
I realize that not wanting a house full of things makes me look weird and recently even "unpatriotic.
我意识到，不想要一个装满东西的房子，让我看起来很奇怪，最近甚至有些“不爱国”。

事实上，通过交易的另一端，储蓄与其他人在欲望上花费的钱一样多，在全职工作五年后就可以退休，并依靠投资储蓄生活。
Rather than increasing the amount of work to acquire more stuff, reducing this superficial need reduces the amount of necessary work.

It's possible to reduce the amount of work all the way down to zero: financial independence.
可以将工作量一直减少到零：财务独立。
Indeed, playing the shadow game for five years provides a permanent way out of the cave.
事实上，玩五年的影子游戏，提供了一条永久的出路。
Alternatively, it's also possible to return to the cave for a few months every year to earn money for the next adventure out of the cave.
或者，也可以每年回到洞穴几个月，为下一次走出洞冒险赚钱。
This is living on the economy, so to speak, rather than living in the economy.
可以说，这是靠经济生活，而不是生活在经济中。

The  resulting  freedom  can  be  spent  on  personal  projects  such  as  reading books,  visiting  places,  entertaining,  exploring,  cooking,  learning,  and experiencing.

In my mind, financial independence provides a greater sense of balance to one's life compared to doing just  one  thing.
在我看来，与只做一件事相比，经济独立为一个人的生活提供了更大的平衡感。
In  addition,  it  doesn't  postpone  this  balance  until  traditional retirement age, when people who have been stuck in the same place all their life decide that they need to travel, only to find that they're sick of traveling after a while because they never figured out exactly what makes them happy.
此外，它并没有将这种平衡推迟到传统的退休年龄，当那些终生被困在同一个地方的人，决定他们需要旅行时，却发现他们过一段时间就厌倦了旅行，因为他们从来不知道究竟是什么让他们快乐。

The  most  frequent  objection  to  casting  off  the  chains  is  that  living  on something corresponding to every third paycheck, or even every fourth paycheck ($6,000-$10,000 a year), as opposed to living paycheck to paycheck, must be a boring  life.
最常摆脱枷锁的方法是，靠着相当于三份薪水，甚至每四份薪水（每年 6千到1万美元）的东西生活，而不是靠薪水生活，一定是无聊的生活。
Not  knowing  any  better,  I  must  admit  that  I  started  my  own adventure with such assumptions, but back then the knowledge and the wisdom relevant to such an undertaking wasn't as easy to come by as it is today.

Those--and they're a majority--who have to pay for every convenience really need that much to replicate a median income lifestyle.
那些——他们是大多数——必须为每一种便利付费的人，是需要那么多钱，来重复中等收入的生活方式。
As a lifelong consumer used to spending large amounts of money to obtain food, stuff,  and  entertainment,  it's  hard  to  imagine  how  it's  possible  to  spend practically nothing on furniture, a few dollars on clothing, very little on food, almost nothing on transport, and generally less on rent/mortgage.
作为一个习惯于花费大量金钱来获得食物、物品和娱乐的终生消费者，很难想象怎么可能在家具上几乎不花钱，在衣服上花几美元，在食物上花很少的钱，在交通上几乎不花钱，较少的租金/抵押贷款。

However,  it's  possible  to  live  on  a  third  or  even  a  quarter  of  the  median income, putting one solidly below the government defined poverty line, without living in austerity or eating grits.
然而，有可能靠收入中位数的1/3甚至1/4生活，使一个人完全低于政府定义的贫困线，而不必过着节衣缩食的生活。

" You can enjoy the fun of beating the system that exists to take your money and live a middle-class lifestyle on a quarter of the usual numbers.
你可以享受击败现有系统的乐趣，这些系统可以拿你的4倍的钱，让你过上中产阶级的生活方式。
But why aim low? Why not  live  an  upper-class  lifestyle  and  think  of  yourself  as  a  poor  aristocrat?  It requires a somewhat different approach, though, and it requires some skill.
但为什么目标低呢？ 为什么不过上流社会的生活方式，把自己当成一个贫穷的贵族呢？ 它需要一种稍微不同的方法，并且需要一些技巧。
It also requires a reprogramming of "the way we've always done it," or, rather, the way we usually do it.
它还需要对“我们一直这样做的方式”，或者更确切地说，我们通常这样做的方式进行重新编程。
In fact, a frequent question I get when I talk about frugality is  what  kind  of  things,  like  CFLs  or  pressure  cookers  people  should  buy  to become more frugal.
事实上，当我谈论节俭时，回答通常是人们应该购买什么样的东西，比如节能灯或压力锅，以变得更加节俭。
Wrong question, dude! 
问题错了，兄弟！ 

Leaving the cave takes some effort.
离开洞穴需要一些努力。
It would be easy if the framework or mental modes of thinking outside the cave were similar to the shadows.
如果洞穴外的思维框架或思维方式与洞穴里相似，那就简单了。
In that case, I'd write a list of 25 ways to save money, 25 ways to earn money, and 25 ways to save time, and you'd just add them to your checklist and squeeze them in during your lunch hour.
在那种情况下，我会列出 25 种省钱方法、25 种赚钱方法和 25 种节省时间的方法，然后你只需将它们添加到你的清单中，然后把它们在午餐时间挤进去。
It's acceptable to use these lists as inspirations, but don't follow them like recipes.
使用这些列表作为灵感是可以接受的，但不要像食谱一样遵循它们。
You'd be missing the point.
你会错过重点。
To paraphrase Einstein, you can't solve your problems with the same mindset that created them.
套用爱因斯坦的话，你不能用创造问题的心态来解决问题。
To live as a free person, following lists of easy, repetitive things, possibly in return for some reward, is exactly what should be avoided.
作为一个自由的人生活，遵循一系列简单的、重复的事情，可能是为了回报一些回报，正是应该避免的。
Instead, it's necessary to understand  how  the  world  works  and  how  people  have  been  specialized  to  the  point  of general incompetence, like ants, which only know how to do one job, but do it very well; this is not human nature.
相反，有必要了解世界是如何运作的，以及人们如何被专业化到普遍无能的地步，就像蚂蚁一样，它们只知道如何做一项工作，做得很好； 但这不是人性。

想烧烤，却没有烤架？ 去买一个而不是做一个火坑。

Perhaps the best advice to overcoming this consumerist tendency to "buy, buy,  buy!"  is  to  study  alternative  sources  of  information.
也许最好的克服这种“买、买、买！”的消费主义倾向的建议是，研究替代的信息来源。

, and then I have adapted these ideas to my own life.

To successfully break free of one's chains, one must build an overarching philosophy  of  what  it  means  to  live,  which  is  different  from  the  consumer  philosophy of "follow advice/orders; work; get paycheck; spend paycheck; get stuff; repeat.
要成功摆脱束缚，必须建立一种关于生活意义的总体哲学，这与“听从建议/命令；工作；获得薪水；花薪水；得到东西；重复”的消费者哲学不同。

" Those who merely try to implement small changes like "25 Frugal Tips  To  Save  Money"  to  have  more  money  to  spend  have  actions  that  are entirely  misaligned  with  their  goals,  and  they  will  fail  for  exactly  the  same reasons  that  most  diets  fail.
那些仅仅尝试实施诸如，“省钱的 25 条节俭小贴士”之类的小改变，省更多的钱，然后来花更多的钱，和他们设定的目标完全背离。这和节食失败者的失败原因相同。
What's  more,  they  will  have  experienced  much mental  anguish  before  finally  capitulating  and  declaring,  "Enough  of  this frugality," or,  "I  want  to  splurge;  I  deserve  it,"  or,  "I  give  up;  I'll  just  hire  a professional."  No,  one's  entire  philosophy  must  change.
更重要的是，他们在最终投降并宣布“受够了这种节俭”或“我想挥霍；我应得的”或“我放弃；我会聘请专业人士”之前，会经历很多精神痛苦。 不，一个人的整个哲学必须改变。
Later  on  I  offer  a philosophy  modeled  on  the  Renaissance  ideal  of  the  17th  century  and  the craftsmen of the 18th century who wrote the Constitution of the United States at the peak of the Age of Enlightenment.
稍后，我提供了一种哲学，其模型以 17 世纪的文艺复兴理想，和18世纪的工匠为蓝本，他们在启蒙时代的巅峰时期起草了美国宪法。
This is a framework of complexity where a  person  is  skilled  in  more  than  just  one  area.
这是一个复杂的框架，这里一个人不仅精通一个领域。
It  is,  in  a  way,  a  contrarian approach  to  the  contemporary  idea  of  "one  man-one  specialization.
在某种程度上，这和当代“一个人一种专长”理念的完全相反。

Naturally, I do not expect everybody to like this philosophy.
当然，我不期望每个人都喜欢这种哲学。
We typically tend to like philosophies that are already somewhat aligned with our personal values and talents.
我们通常倾向于喜欢，已经与我们的个人价值观和才能一致的哲学。
For example, books like this one, which first tell you that everything  about  our  current  society  is  wrong,  and  then  try  to  offer  an alternative, are mostly a reflection of the author's values rather than an absolute view.
例如，像本书，首先告诉你，我们当前社会的一切都是错误的，然后试图提供另一种选择，大多观点是作者价值观的反映，而不是绝对的。
We're all different and it's up to each of us to develop, grow, and walk our unique path.
我们都是不同的，发展、成长和走我们独特的道路取决于我们自己。
This is what it means to be human.
这就是成为人的意义。
One thing is certain, though: conspicuous consumption is not a natural state for all of us.
不过，有一件事是肯定的：炫耀性消费并不是我们所有人的自然状态。

This change isn't easy.  Not everybody can do it.  In a sense, it's like running a marathon or getting into shape.
这种改变并不容易。 不是每个人都能做到的。 从某种意义上说，这就像跑马拉松或塑身。
Running a marathon is technically easy, but few have the persistence to actually go through with it, and even fewer are already in such a physical condition so as to do it without preparation.
跑马拉松在技术上很容易，但很少有人有毅力去真正去完成它，更没有人没有准备，就已经有这样的身体状况。
Mental blocks are similar.
心理障碍是相似的。
It's much easier to say that something can't work than it is to find a way to make it work.
说某件事行不通，要比找到一种方法使它可行容易得多。
There are always excuses.
总有借口。
"I don't want it enough;" "It'd be nice, but I can't do it," they say.
“我想要的还不够多；” “这很好，但我做不到，”他们说。
Of course they can do it.
他们当然可以做到。
There are no laws of physics that forbid it.
没有任何物理定律禁止它。
There are, thankfully, no laws of society that forbid it, either.
谢天谢地，也没有社会法律禁止这样做。
They just prefer their convenient, predictable, and comfortable misery.
他们只是更喜欢方便、可预测和舒适的痛苦。
So don't  expect  people  to  immediately  understand  when  you  start  casting  your chains off.
因此，在你卸下枷锁后，不要指望人们会立即理解。
There will also be resistance from "well-adjusted" people who like to see everybody fit a particular mold and who don't tolerate anyone with different values.
“适应良好”的人也会抵制，他们喜欢看到每个人都适合特定的模式，并且不会容忍任何具有不同价值观的人。
They'll  tell  you  that  you  are  unrealistic  and irresponsible,  and  maybe speak  of  duty:  "If  you  don't  work,  you're  lazy.   If  you  don't  spend,  you're unpatriotic." Yet these same people may feel stuck in a life of quiet desperation-- stuck because they've convinced themselves that everything is good as long as others are living the same way.
他们会告诉你，你不切实际，不负责任，也许会讲责任：“不工作就是懒惰；不花钱就是不爱国。” 然而，这些人可能会感到陷入平静的绝望生活——陷入困境是因为他们说服自己，只要其他人以同样的方式生活，一切都是好的。
In the best case, people will be slightly amused at what a crackpot you are: "Yes, that is interesting and may be fine for you, but I could  never..."  Even  once  you're  living  the  good  life,  they  will  still  not understand, because according to the shadows, what you're doing doesn't make sense: "But you don't have a lawn!"
在最好的情况下，人们会因为你是一个多么疯狂的人而被逗笑：“是的，这很有趣，对你来说可能很好，但我永远不会......”即使你过上了美好的生活，他们也会还是不明白，因为根据影子，你在做什么没有意义：“但你没有草坪！”

However, you might be surprised to see that eventually the people around you, your previously doubting friends and family, will start to adopt some of your behavioral patterns.
然而，你可能会惊讶地发现，最终你周围的人，你以前怀疑的朋友和家人，会开始采用你的一些行为模式。
While they will not take the lead, they will follow your example.
虽然他们不会带头，但他们会以你为榜样。
What Gandhi said; "Be the change you want to see," may sound trite, but  that  doesn't  make  it  untrue.
甘地说过； “成为你想看到的改变”，这听起来可能很陈词滥调，但这并不意味着它不真实。
It  works  far  better  than  trying  to  institute policies! You don't need to wait for change while gathering forces; just change.
它比试图制定政策要好得多！ 积蓄力量时无需等待变化； 只是改变。

If enough people do it, it will start a slow revolution from the bottom up.
如果有足够多的人去做，它将开始一场自下而上的缓慢革命。
When people have more time as a result of working less, because they need less money to satisfy their wants, more things will get done, because it's the right thing to do--the  world  will  be  slightly  better  for  it. 
当人们因工作减少而有更多时间时，因为他们需要更少的钱来满足他们的需要，就会做更多的事情，因为这是正确的事情——世界会因此而稍微好一点。
For  those  who  choose  to  do  it, attaining financial independence in a handful of years will provide them the time and  freedom,  the  lack  of  which  has  previously  prevented  them  from  getting things  done  and  caused  relations  with  friends  to  stagnate  or  degenerate  into acquaintances or "networking opportunities."
对于那些选择这样做的人来说，在几年内实现经济独立，将为他们提供时间和自由，而缺乏时间和自由使他们无法完成工作，并导致与朋友的关系停滞或退化为熟人或“网络机会。”

Financial  independence  and  extreme  early  retirement  are  still  for  the explorers and the pioneers of a new lifestyle. 
经济独立和极早退休，仍然是探索者和新生活方式的先驱。
They will be followed by others.
他们将被其他人跟随。
Now there are few to follow, but I predict that within a decade or so there will be many others--more on this later.
现在很少有人关注，但我预测在十年左右的时间里会有很多人——稍后会更多。
