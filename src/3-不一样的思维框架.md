When I grew up, I dutifully went to school and did my homework. 
在我成长中，我一直尽职的上学完成作业。

For the
most part, schooling was about sitting still for 45 minutes while doing simple
tasks that the teacher handed out. 
大多数时候，学校就是安静地坐45分钟，同时完成老师的任务。

I was very good at sitting still and thus I was a
good student.
我很擅长老实儿地坐着，所以我是个好学生。

 I learned how to add, multiply, divide, and subtract. 
 我学着怎么加减乘除。

 I learned how
to punctuate a sentence and how to spell.
我学着怎么发音和拼写。

 I learned something about chemistry.
我学了一些化学知识。


Then I learned something about physics and geology.
接着我又学了一些关于物理和地质的东西。

 At some point, the teacher
introduced tests and grades. 
到了一些时间点，老师指导着考试和升学。

Test-taking became the primary objective; 
接受考试是主要的目标，

learning
secondary. 
学习，次要的。

We had the option to quickly forget what we had spent the past year
learning  after  the  test  was  done.  
考试完成，我们很快就忘了我们花几年时间所学的东西。

In  other  words,  we  were  being  taught  to  be
"flexible." 
换句话说，我们被教会了要“灵活”。

Later, there were job fairs and educational fairs telling us how to write
résumés and how to interview so we could get jobs.
之后，工作市场和教育市场教我们如何写简历，如何面试，然后我们才能得到工作。

Yet, I never learned why the world worked the way it did, and in retrospect, I
think nobody ever even asked the question. 
然而，我从没学到这个世界为什么像这样运转，回想起来，我认为也没人曾经问过同样的问题。

Everybody always only focused on
the  "what"  and  "where;" 
每个人永远只关注“什么”和“哪里”

 no  questions  asked.  
 没有质疑。

 But  as  I  started  my  career as  a
research assistant in physics, 
但是当我开始我的物理研究助理的职业生涯，

I started getting interested in all the "whys" of life.
我开始对生活中所有的“为啥”感兴趣。

As I studied and thought about various fundamental questions such as, "Why do
we use money instead of promises or favors?"; 
我研究和思考了一堆基础性的问题，比如“为啥我们用钱而不是承诺或者人情？”；

"Why do we live in houses and
not boats or cars?"; 
“为啥我们住房子里而不是在船里或车里？”；

"Why are there usually 2-4 people in a home and not 10-
20?"; 
“为啥我们一个房子里住2-4个人而不是10-20个？”；

"Why do we move away from home?"; 
“为啥我们要从家里搬出去？”；


"Why do we work until we're 65?"
“为啥我们要工作到65岁？”；

that I should
make sure to open a retirement account before I was 30 and put 15% of net
income into it; 


that I should buy a house; 

that married homeowners were more
prosperous and therefore I better get married too; 


that I should buy a new car;


that people would like me more if I wore a particular kind of brand clothing, 

and that I would enjoy a beverage more if it came from a certain kind of bottle. 

I was
beginning to feel that something was wrong. 


"Why is the emperor not wearing
any clothes?" I started getting an uneasy feeling that something about the world
was not quite right.


 Nobody explained the "why." 
 
 
 Sure, they could explain how I
should first purchase a "starter home," so I could "upgrade" later. But nobody
could or would explain why I should buy a house in the first place. Nobody
could or would explain why I should have a career, only that career development
was important
There  are  a  few  allegories  that  explain  this  progression  in  thinking.  The
oldest is Plato's Cave.4 In Plato's Cave prisoners have been arranged in a row in
a  dark  cave  since  childhood.  They're  chained  so  that  they  can't  move  their
bodies, and their heads are restrained too so they can only face forward, towards
a wall. They can hear and speak but they can't see each other, nor can they see
themselves.  Behind  them  is  a  fire.  The  fire's  light  shows  the  shadows  of  the
prisoners on the wall. Between the prisoners and the fire there are people and
animals  acting  out  a  realistic  play  casting  shadows  on  the  wall  as  well.  The
prisoners see only the shadows, but they hear all the sounds. Naturally they think
the  world  is  composed  of  shadows  on  the  wall  and  that  they  themselves  are
shadows  on  the  wall.  The  shadows  talk  to  each  other  and  interact,  and  it  all
makes sense to the prisoners, who think that all the shadows on the wall are like
themselves. The prisoners even know each other through the shadows they see
and the voices they hear, and they gain status by their ability to recognize other
shadows and predict what they'll do. Now, imagine that one of the prisoners is
released. His shackles fall to the ground and he can turn his head. He sees the
other prisoners sitting in a row chained to the ground and he's horrified. He also
sees the actors and animals between the prisoners and the fire. He sees the cave
opening and ventures out. He is blinded by the light, but finally sees the big
picture: All his life he has been sitting in a cave, chained to the ground, believing
that the wall was it. Now he has realized that the action on the wall is guided
mainly by a few actors, with the prisoners providing commentary. Now he sees
the opportunities in the real world. He feels duty-bound to go back and inform
the prisoners of the situation and try to release them. First he tries to explain the
existence of the puppet-masters to the prisoners, but the masters are unlikely to
corroborate his story since they derive much personal benefit from the current
way of the world. Then he tries to explain how the system is arranged with the
prisoners and the cave. Tragically, he finds the prisoners more resistant than he
expected. Most don't believe him--and why should they? Having adjusted to the
light outside, he can't see the shadows as clearly as they can. "What a dimwit."
Taking off the chains requires too much effort, so most of them remain seated.
These are people who are very good and successful at identifying, naming, and
dealing with shadows, and so they may not want to leave.
There are also those who do feel the need to leave. Leaving is not easy; it
requires much learning and a reorientation of one's values from equating success
with identifying shadows to equating success with moving around in the real
world.
In  real  life,  the  prisoners  of  Plato's  Cave  are  those  who  are  prisoners  or
slaves to their wages and their culture. A wage slave is a wage earner who is
entirely  dependent  on  their  wages.  While  the  wage  slave  is  free  to  leave  the
current job, he isn't free to leave the job market altogether and he can likely not
imagine the possibility of doing so. He is still entirely focused on the wall.
The wall shows other people not as who they are, but as what they own.
There goes a man in his new sports car--what is not seen is that the car is bought
on credit and that the man is stressed because he is having trouble making the
payments.
Wage slaves have jobs where they can go and spend their most productive
hours writing high-powered memos so they can be more productive, while other
people spend their time ignoring memos so they can be more productive too.
This is how it goes. In fact, one of the great inventions of the 20th century, the
personal computer, has made it possible to write even more memos and notices.
This is great because it allows people to do their job while looking busier than
ever. Looking busy is important because in this culture business is a virtue, just
as being in debt is a virtue, and the most virtuous are those with the highest
credit scores.  They're  better  at  being  in  debt  compared  to  other  people.  This
endless working and paying is called "making a living," yet people are so busy
"making a living" that they have no time for living. A wage slave is a person
who is not only economically bound by mortgages, loans, and other obligations,
but also mentally bound by an inability to perceive that there are other options
available, like the prisoners in Plato's Cave. Their chains are not physical like
those of 150 years ago (though they still are in some parts of the world); the
chains are mental, which in some sense makes them worse, because it turns the
prisoners into their own prison wardens. Like the slaves in Plato's Cave, the only
commonly accepted way for one of them to leave is to win the "prison game,"
which means accumulating at least a million to retire.5
The disenchanted grumble about "the system" or "the man." The analogy of
"the system" is the people walking around behind the chained slaves, keeping
them going. However, it's mainly the slaves themselves who keep themselves
going. We don't realize that we maintain this system by lack of imagination and
questioning. Like birds, which never seem to have a flight plan, yet always seem
to  fly  together  in  a  swarming  flock,  we  don't  question.  We  obediently  pick
whatever options are handed to us, often choosing based on what our neighbors
have  chosen.  We  make  the  best  of  the  shadows  on  the  wall,  but  we  do  not
question the wall. The best prison is the one with invisible bars.
Perhaps  one  reason  for  this  complacency  is  the  large  quantity  of  material
goods  available  to  the  chain  gang.  Material  goods  are  often  used  as
compensation. Frequently, when someone is depressed, the advice is "Go out and
spend  some  money.  Buy  yourself  something  nice.  Treat  yourself.  Try  a  little
retail therapy."  People  don't  seem  to  realize  that  this  attempt  to  feel  good  is
exactly  what  propagates  the  problem.  Compared  to  people  just  50  years  ago,
modern wage slaves live a life of material abundance. They're consumers. They
have  big-screen  TVs,  movies  on  demand,  microwave  ovens,  food  processors,
and 24-piece flatware. They own multiple pairs of shoes and enough clothes for
more than a week without doing laundry. They have carpeted floors, matching
furniture,  and  vacuum  cleaners.  They  have  expensive  toys.  They  have  car
payments,  college  degrees,  five-bedroom/three-bathroom  mortgages,  laptop
computers, cell phone contracts, power tools with 108-piece bit sets, premium
cable,  air  conditioning  systems,  blenders,  food  processors,  pool  tables,  DVD
players, and granite countertops. They redecorate, attend sporting events, go on
vacations, and occasionally play with their toys.
Society has made it very easy to spend money. Shopping centers line every
street. Many creative means of spending money have been devised. Instead of
spending 30 seconds opening a can of tomatoes with a traditional can opener, it's
now possible to spend 30 minutes working to pay for an electric can opener that
can open the can in the same amount of time. Similarly, many of the ways we
used  to  do  things  have  been  redesigned  to  ensure  that  instead  of  doing  it
ourselves, we can buy some gadget or some service to have it done for us. This
is  convenient,  because  we're  usually  too  busy  working  to  pay  for  it  to  do  it
ourselves. This is the gist of the service economy; presumably, if we didn't create
enough problems to spend time solving them, the economy would collapse.
To  speed  up  consumption,  it's  possible  to  obtain  loans  and  spend  money
that's yet to be earned. All it requires is a promise of increased amounts of work
in the future, and a commitment of up to 30 years to pay the money back--plus
twice the amount in interest. Lots of personal finance gurus are willing to charge
you money (some will do it for free) to advise you as to exactly how to distribute
your money into retirement plans, college savings plans, mortgages, credit cards,
etc. to maximize your lifetime consumption. Success and power are equated with
spending money.
It usually starts with toys for the children and quickly evolves to cell phones
and fashionable clothes. Many realize that demonstrating their personal values
through the color and build of their cell phone is perhaps inadequate and then
move on to bigger and more expensive propositions like large cars, redecorating,
or kitchen renovating. Not that there's anything wrong with such creative outlets,
but the scale of these "projects" is often mind-boggling, with tens of thousands
being spent on marginal increases in functionality. The old but typically fully
functioning items are discarded, especially if they have those ugly 1970s earth
tone colors, or that bland 1980s beige, or whatever we had in the 1990s, etc. Try
for a moment to envision the large pile of abandoned yet functional telephones,
TVs, furniture, toys, old clothes and shoes, LPs, CDs, and packaging material
that  you  have  discarded  so  far  in  your  life.  Such  stuff  doesn't  magically
disappear. It goes somewhere, typically a landfill. Now multiply that by several
hundred million people--not cool! In the same vein, tally up the sum total of
your earned income so far, subtract your savings, and compare the difference to
your pile of stuff. Was it really a good deal?
Is spending the most productive years of your life chained to the job market
to collect a lot of rarely used stuff that gathers dust in the closet or takes up space
in junkyards a wise choice? Were you really born just to die, leaving a large pile
of discarded consumer goods? Probably not. I realize that not wanting a house
full of things makes me look weird and recently even "unpatriotic." After all,
more is better, and who doesn't want to be better? But perhaps conformity is not
the only way to live. In fact, by taking the other end of the bargain, saving as
much as other people are spending on wants, it's possible to retire and live on
invested savings after just five years of full-time work. Rather than increasing the
amount of work to acquire more stuff, reducing this superficial need reduces the
amount of necessary work. It's possible to reduce the amount of work all the way
down to zero: financial independence. Indeed, playing the shadow game for five
years provides a permanent way out of the cave. Alternatively, it's also possible
to return to the cave for a few months every year to earn money for the next
adventure out of the cave. This is living on the economy, so to speak, rather than
living in the economy.
The  resulting  freedom  can  be  spent  on  personal  projects  such  as  reading
books,  visiting  places,  entertaining,  exploring,  cooking,  learning,  and
experiencing. It can also be used to start businesses, engage in a second career,
care for family members, etc. without worrying about having to support oneself.
This book explains how, but it really becomes quite simple once you realize that
the option is there. I have done it, and others have, too. In my mind, financial
independence provides a greater sense of balance to one's life compared to doing
just  one  thing.  In  addition,  it  doesn't  postpone  this  balance  until  traditional
retirement age, when people who have been stuck in the same place all their life
decide that they need to travel, only to find that they're sick of traveling after a
while because they never figured out exactly what makes them happy.
The  most  frequent  objection  to  casting  off  the  chains  is  that  living  on
something corresponding to every third paycheck, or even every fourth paycheck
($6,000-$10,000 a year), as opposed to living paycheck to paycheck, must be a
boring  life.  Not  knowing  any  better,  I  must  admit  that  I  started  my  own
adventure with such assumptions, but back then the knowledge and the wisdom
relevant to such an undertaking wasn't as easy to come by as it is today. I had to
discover everything from scratch. I grew up as a consumer and spent my money
on increasingly larger toys. I knew a ton about various CPUs, and how to match
memory and graphics cards to build the ultimate gaming platform. I also had
pretty  good  hand-eye  coordination  from  many  hours  spent  playing  computer
games. Like most consumers, I was wholly ignorant of ways to attain a high-
quality life without spending money. This is why retirement savings goals are
frequently in the millions. Those--and they're a majority--who have to pay for
every convenience really need that much to replicate a median income lifestyle.
As a lifelong consumer used to spending large amounts of money to obtain food,
stuff,  and  entertainment,  it's  hard  to  imagine  how  it's  possible  to  spend
practically nothing on furniture, a few dollars on clothing, very little on food,
almost nothing on transport, and generally less on rent/mortgage.
However,  it's  possible  to  live  on  a  third  or  even  a  quarter  of  the  median
income, putting one solidly below the government defined poverty line, without
living in austerity or eating grits. There is no reason to pay "retail." You can
enjoy the fun of beating the system that exists to take your money and live a
middle-class lifestyle on a quarter of the usual numbers. But why aim low? Why
not  live  an  upper-class  lifestyle  and  think  of  yourself  as  a  poor  aristocrat?  It
requires a somewhat different approach, though, and it requires some skill. It
also requires a reprogramming of "the way we've always done it," or, rather, the
way we usually do it. In fact, a frequent question I get when I talk about frugality
is  what  kind  of  things,  like  CFLs  or  pressure  cookers  people  should  buy  to
become more frugal. Wrong question, dude!
Leaving the cave takes some effort. It would be easy if the framework or
mental modes of thinking outside the cave were similar to the shadows. In that
case, I'd write a list of 25 ways to save money, 25 ways to earn money, and 25
ways to save time, and you'd just add them to your checklist and squeeze them in
during your lunch hour. It's acceptable to use these lists as inspirations, but don't
follow them like recipes. You'd be missing the point. To paraphrase Einstein, you
can't solve your problems with the same mindset that created them. To live as a
free person, following lists of easy, repetitive things, possibly in return for some
reward, is exactly what should be avoided. Instead, it's necessary to understand
how  the  world  works  and  how  people  have  been  specialized  to  the  point  of
general incompetence, like ants, which only know how to do one job, but do it
very well; this is not human nature. To live well, one must go beyond lists and
start  thinking  creatively  about  solving  problems.  One  must  accept  a  lot  more
personal  responsibility  than  merely  showing  up  on  time,  following  orders,
checking off boxes, and trying to fit in. One must learn the general systemic
rules that allow one to improvise and really live life the way it was intended--in
your own way, rather than following checklists devised by some random guy
like me. One must start thinking creatively about how to solve problems. Most
of life's challenges can be thought of as problems with solutions. Some problems
are self-created; one must learn to avoid these. A common solution to problems
is to go and buy some product. Too weak to open a lid? Go buy a tool rather than
exercise to become stronger. Want to barbecue, but don't have a grill? Go buy
one instead of making a fire pit.
Perhaps the best advice to overcoming this consumerist tendency to "buy,
buy,  buy!"  is  to  study  alternative  sources  of  information.  Ignore  most  of  the
personal finance books out there. They only explain how to play the game by the
rules. Instead, use the rules to play a different game. Remember that the shadows
on the wall are just a part of life. There's no reason to only follow the rules of the
shadows. I have been inspired by many different sources: books on backpacking,
observations of animals and ecosystems, boating, cycling, people living in cars--
even  the  homeless.  I  have  read  books  on  systems  theory,  biology,  physics,
finance,  as  well  as  more  practical  manuals  on  plumbing,  house  wiring,
construction, etc., and then I have adapted these ideas to my own life.
To successfully break free of one's chains, one must build an overarching
philosophy  of  what  it  means  to  live,  which  is  different  from  the  consumer
philosophy of "follow advice/orders; work; get paycheck; spend paycheck; get
stuff; repeat." Those who merely try to implement small changes like "25 Frugal
Tips  To  Save  Money"  to  have  more  money  to  spend  have  actions  that  are
entirely  misaligned  with  their  goals,  and  they  will  fail  for  exactly  the  same
reasons  that  most  diets  fail.  What's  more,  they  will  have  experienced  much
mental  anguish  before  finally  capitulating  and  declaring,  "Enough  of  this
frugality," or,  "I  want  to  splurge;  I  deserve  it,"  or,  "I  give  up;  I'll  just  hire  a
professional."  No,  one's  entire  philosophy  must  change.  Later  on  I  offer  a
philosophy  modeled  on  the  Renaissance  ideal  of  the  17th  century  and  the
craftsmen of the 18th century who wrote the Constitution of the United States at
the peak of the Age of Enlightenment. This is a framework of complexity where
a  person  is  skilled  in  more  than  just  one  area.  It  is,  in  a  way,  a  contrarian
approach  to  the  contemporary  idea  of  "one  man-one  specialization."  It's  an
interlocking way of arranging one's life. In risk management parlance, one wants
to transfer from a tightly coupled linear system of financed consumerism to a
loosely  coupled,  complex  system  of  the  financially  independent  Renaissance
man.
Naturally, I do not expect everybody to like this philosophy. We typically
tend to like philosophies that are already somewhat aligned with our personal
values and talents. For example, books like this one, which first tell you that
everything  about  our  current  society  is  wrong,  and  then  try  to  offer  an
alternative, are mostly a reflection of the author's values rather than an absolute
view. We're all different and it's up to each of us to develop, grow, and walk our
unique path. This is what it means to be human. One thing is certain, though:
conspicuous consumption is not a natural state for all of us.
This change isn't easy. Not everybody can do it. In a sense, it's like running a
marathon or getting into shape. Running a marathon is technically easy, but few
have the persistence to actually go through with it, and even fewer are already in
such a physical condition so as to do it without preparation. Mental blocks are
similar. It's much easier to say that something can't work than it is to find a way
to make it work. There are always excuses. "I don't want it enough;" "It'd be
nice, but I can't do it," they say. Of course they can do it. There are no laws of
physics that forbid it. There are, thankfully, no laws of society that forbid it,
either. They just prefer their convenient, predictable, and comfortable misery. So
don't  expect  people  to  immediately  understand  when  you  start  casting  your
chains off. There will also be resistance from "well-adjusted" people who like to
see everybody fit a particular mold and who don't tolerate anyone with different
values.  They'll  tell  you  that  you  are  unrealistic  and  irresponsible,  and  maybe
speak  of  duty:  "If  you  don't  work,  you're  lazy.  If  you  don't  spend,  you're
unpatriotic." Yet these same people may feel stuck in a life of quiet desperation--
stuck because they've convinced themselves that everything is good as long as
others are living the same way. In the best case, people will be slightly amused at
what a crackpot you are: "Yes, that is interesting and may be fine for you, but I
could  never..."  Even  once  you're  living  the  good  life,  they  will  still  not
understand, because according to the shadows, what you're doing doesn't make
sense: "But you don't have a lawn!"
However, you might be surprised to see that eventually the people around
you, your previously doubting friends and family, will start to adopt some of
your behavioral patterns. While they will not take the lead, they will follow your
example. What Gandhi said; "Be the change you want to see," may sound trite,
but  that  doesn't  make  it  untrue.  It  works  far  better  than  trying  to  institute
policies! You don't need to wait for change while gathering forces; just change.
If enough people do it, it will start a slow revolution from the bottom up. When
people have more time as a result of working less, because they need less money
to satisfy their wants, more things will get done, because it's the right thing to
do--the  world  will  be  slightly  better  for  it.  For  those  who  choose  to  do  it,
attaining financial independence in a handful of years will provide them the time
and  freedom,  the  lack  of  which  has  previously  prevented  them  from  getting
things  done  and  caused  relations  with  friends  to  stagnate  or  degenerate  into
acquaintances or "networking opportunities."
Financial  independence  and  extreme  early  retirement  are  still  for  the
explorers and the pioneers of a new lifestyle. They will be followed by others.
Now there are few to follow, but I predict that within a decade or so there will be
many others--more on this later.
