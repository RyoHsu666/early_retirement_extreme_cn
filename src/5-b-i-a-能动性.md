Humans with an internal locus of control--the belief that they're in control
and that they're the masters of their own destiny--possess agency. 

人类有内在的控制轨迹——相信一切尽在掌握并且他们是自己命运的主宰——拥有能动性。

Agency resists
and  reduces  stress.  

能动性抵御并减少压力。

Anyone  who  has  been  out  in  the  world  for  a  while  and
experienced a lot of different situations has a good idea of what is normal, and
thus  can  describe  a  bad  situation  as  what  it  is:  simply  a  bad  situation.

任何一个与外部世界互动过一段时间的人，并且有很多不同经历的人，都会有一个关于什么是正常的好想法，也能描述什么是一个坏的情况：就是一个坏的情况。

Conversely, people with less agency and a belief that they are not in control of
their destiny are more likely to be stressed and to suffer the associated health
effects. 

相反的，较少能动性的人认为他们的命运不在自己的控制下，更可能并遭受相应压力的健康影响。

Combined with self-confidence, 

关联上自信因素，

agency is the attitude that any problem
can  be  fixed, 


 given  enough  resources  in  the  form  of  time,  effort,  and
determination. 

通过机遇足够的时间、精力、决定等形式的资源，能动性是一种任何问题能被解决的态度。

This attitude rests either on a thorough knowledge of or training
in what is to be done, 

这种态度是通过知识或者训练来完成的，

or on the surety that such knowledge or training can be
attained. 



This attitude is often transferable from one field to another, completely
unrelated field.

这种态度经常从一个领域转移到另一个完全不相关的领域。

 Doing something that is considered very difficult at least once in
your life is highly recommended.

做一些在你生命中看起来是完全不可能的事情是非常推荐的。
