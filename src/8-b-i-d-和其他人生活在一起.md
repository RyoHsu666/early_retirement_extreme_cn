Minimal use of certain facilities calls for their sharing with other people.
对某些设施的最少使用需要与其他人共享。
The easiest way to share is to live with others, or at least next to them.
最简单的分享方式是和别人一起生活，或者至少和他们住在一起。
Recently the trend  has  been  the  exact  opposite,  with  more  and  more  people  living  by themselves  and  building  rooms  that  provide  utility  just  for  them,  like  home theaters, rec rooms, bars, etc.
最近的趋势正好相反，越来越多的人独自生活，建造只为他们提供公用设施的房间，如家庭影院、娱乐室、酒吧等。
Sharing things as in dorms, communes, or families represents  enormous  savings.
在宿舍、公社或家庭中分享东西代表着巨大的节约。
If  you're  a  student  it's  tempting  to  move  from home, as I did, but there are many savings to be had by staying at home, both for you  and  your  parents.
如果你是一名学生，像我一样，很容易从家里搬出去，但是呆在家里可以为你和你的父母节省很多钱。
You  will  also  reduce  the  work  associated  with  cooking, laundry, etc.
你还可以减少与烹饪、洗衣等相关的工作。
Consider that resources are being wasted whenever an asset is lying dormant.
考虑到当资产处于休眠状态时，资源被浪费掉的。
Spending 8-10 hours out of the home, eight hours sleeping, and a few hours  doing  "other"  leaves  very  few  hours  for  using  the  "home."  
出门8-10个小时，睡8个小时，再花几个小时做“其他”事情，就没有多少时间使用“家”了。
As  such spending a lot of money on one's home makes little sense since one's "effective place  of  being"  is  actually  one's  job  or  office.
因此，在家里花很多钱是没有意义的，因为一个人的“有效的存在地”实际上是一个人的工作或办公室。
The  fewer  the  users  of  a  given room, the more resources are wasted.
给定房间的使用者越少，浪费的资源就越多。
Some rooms in many homes are used very rarely, such as the bathroom and the kitchen, both rooms on which it has become popular to spend a lot of money, ironically.
许多家庭中的一些房间很少使用，比如浴室和厨房，讽刺的是，这两个房间都很受欢迎，可以花很多钱。
Other rooms, like the dining room or sitting room, are practically never used.
其他房间，如餐厅或客厅，更是几乎从未使用过。
This leaves the bedroom.
离开卧室。
When sharing, one has to avoid queuing problems.
共享时，必须避免排队问题。
If you live in a place where everybody needs to leave at seven in the morning and wants to get up at the same time, you have a queuing  problem.
如果你居住的地方每个人都需要在早上七点离开，并且想同时起床，那么你就有排队问题。
This  is  typically  solved  by  having  multiple  bathrooms.
这通常通过拥有多个浴室来解决。
This ridiculous waste can be solved by a slight change of habit (someone gets up half an hour earlier) or simply by living with people who have different habits.
这种荒谬的浪费可以通过稍微改变习惯（有人提前半小时起床）或简单地与不同习惯的人生活在一起来解决。

When  I  was  a  grad  student,  I  lived  in  a  dorm.
当我还是一名研究生时，我住在宿舍里。
More  accurately,  as  I  spent most of my waking hours in my office, I realized that I effectively lived in my office.
更准确地说，当我醒着的大部分时间都在办公室里时，我意识到我实际上是生活在办公室里。
The dorm room I had was just a place where I slept.
我住的宿舍只是我睡觉的地方。
I'd sleep about 7-9 hours a day, which effectively meant my bed had a duty cycle of 33%, which is probably  what  most  bedrooms  see;  except  a  berth  on  a  small  ship,  which  may see 66% or even 100% use as one person can sleep while the other is on watch.
我每天睡7-9个小时，这实际上意味着我的床有33%的占空比，这可能是大多数卧室的状态；除了小船上的一个泊位，这可能会看到66%甚至100%的使用，因为一个人可以在另一个人值班时睡觉。
I cooked  once  every  six  days--I  did  all  my  own  cooking--and  ate  in  my  room.
我每六天做一次饭——我自己做饭——然后在房间里吃饭。
Cooking took 30 minutes a week.
做饭每周花30分钟。
Therefore, if I had had my own kitchen, my duty cycle would have been 0.5 / (6×24)=0.347%, which is a waste of resources.
因此，如果我有自己的厨房，我的占空比将是 0.5 / (6×24)=0.347%，这将是资源的浪费。
It therefore made sense to share the kitchen with others--18 others.
因此，与其他人共享厨房是有意义的——其他18人。
I avoided the crowds due to my work schedule.
由于我的工作安排，我避开了人群。
I'm at my most creative during evenings and nights, when there are few distractions.
我在傍晚和晚上最有创造力，几乎没有分心的事情。
Hence I would cook and do laundry at two  in  the  morning.
因此，我会在凌晨两点做饭和洗衣服。
Showers  and  toilets  were  also  shared  (and  professionally cleaned daily).
淋浴间和厕所也是共用的（而且每天都要进行专业清洁）。
This also makes sense.
这也是有道理的。
After all, how much time do you spend in the  bathroom?  For  my  schedule  and  priorities,  my  living  arrangements,  10 minutes away from my office, were fully optimized, with very little waste.
毕竟，你在浴室里花了多少时间？就我的日程安排和优先事项而言，距离办公室10分钟的生活安排得到了充分优化，几乎没有浪费。

Many consider living with other people a horrible idea.
很多人认为和别人住在一起是个可怕的想法。
I suspect this is due to  atrophied  social  skills  from  living  apart  in  houses,  and  lately,  in  rooms.
我怀疑这是因为分开居住导致了社交技能的下降。
Perhaps  a  criteria  for  moving  in  with  anyone,  for  instance  your  spouse  or  a friend,  should  be  sufficient  social  skills  to  be  able  to  tolerate  being  together  in small quarters.
也许，与任何人（比如你的配偶或朋友）同居的标准应该是具备足够的社交技能，能够忍受在小房间里待在一起。
Learn to be easy to get along with.
学会容易相处。
Be considerate.
变体贴。
I'm sure this is a learned skill.
我相信这是一种习得的技能。
Historically, extended families have lived together just fine, and perhaps living under the same roof as Uncle Bob or sharing a house with another family will become the norm once again.
从历史上看，大家庭在一起生活得很好，也许和鲍勃叔叔住在同一个屋檐下，或者与另一个家庭合住一所房子将再次成为常态。

Living together with others provides significant economies of scale, with the largest  effect  realized  by  adding  the  first  person  (see  this  figure  and  Sigmoids, logistic curves, and the maximum power principle).
与他人一起生活可以带来显著的规模经济效益，添加第一个人可以实现最大的效果（参见此[图]()和[S曲线、逻辑曲线和最大能量原理]()）。
The fewer people there are in  a  household  and  the  more  aligned  their  interests  are,  the  fewer  the compromises that have to be made.
一个家庭里的人越少，他们的利益越一致，就越不需要做出妥协。
Therefore, depending on alignment, there's an optimal number of people in a household.
因此，根据排列情况，家庭中有一个最佳人数。
If you can't share rooms with others and/or  living  in  solitude  is  very  important  to  you,  you  need  to  reduce  your expenses  in  other  ways,  by  finding  something  smaller  or  relocating to  another town.
如果你不能与他人共享房间，或者独处对你来说非常重要，那么你需要通过其他方式来减少开支，比如找一些较小的房间或搬到另一个城镇。
