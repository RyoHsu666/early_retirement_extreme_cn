Tactics are often presented as lists. 

战术经常以列表的方式呈现。

These lists are both helpful and useless at
the same time. 

这些列表有用同时又没用。

They are helpful because they allow people to pick up a thing or
two that they have not seen before, but they are useless because few people are
capable of memorizing hundreds of little rules that might not even apply directly
to their situation and remember to obey all of them. 

它们有用是因为它们可以允许人们拾起一两个人们看不到东西，它们没用是因为很少有人能记住数百条小规则，更不用说应用到他们的情境并且遵守它们。

In that sense, tips are like a
collection of pretty postcards or pictures of specific instances of a particular way
of living. 

从这层意义上说，小提示就想收集好看的明信片或者图片来标明一种特殊的生活方式。

They are interesting to look at, but they do not substitute for a map of
the lifestyle, nor do they substitute for navigating the map, and most importantly,
knowing them does not make anyone an expert.

它们看起来挺有趣，但是不能用来作为生活方式的导图，也不能作为导图的向导，最重要的是，知道它们不能让人成为专家。

This is why lists and tips in any field, while greatly entertaining, often fail to
deliver the desired results.

这就是为什么小提示列表在任何领域，非常有娱乐性的，又经常失败的原因。

 Conversely, once the underlying principle has been
identified, the approach becomes intuitive and automatic, thus obviating the need
to follow lists and mechanical methods like budgets or diets.

相反的，一旦原则被标识处来，途径会变得水到渠成，而不是遵从像例餐和预算列表这样的机械方法。

The principle is to define a need or want and then proceed to fulfill that need
or  want  with  an  appropriate  response  (see  Appropriate  response). 

原则是定义需要和想要，然后使用适当的反应去满足需要和想要。（参见适当的反应）

 An
appropriate response to a problem is a solution that uses just enough resources to
solve  the  problem--no  more,  no  less.  

一个适当的反应是用足够的资源去解决一个问题——不多不少。

Since  appropriate  responses  are  rarely
available in the marketplace, taking existing solutions and modifying them for
things they were not intended for is a useful tactic to create more appropriate
solutions.

因为适当的反应在市场上是少见的，采用已有的解法然后修改它们，创造更合适的解法是有用的战术。
