Moving  your  work  to  your  home  eliminates  transportation  to  work  and removes  the  constraint  of  living  close  to  work.

It's  likely  that  it  also  removes other constraints, such as corporate hours and dress code, as well as inconvenient constraints  such  as  not  being  able  to  drop  work  at  a  moment's  notice  if something else comes up.

I prefer supplying products or services that can be sold locally, by mail or online, as this makes it easier to find customers.

Furthermore, if you work in a field with a high return on assets, that is, your income is large relative to your investments in fixed assets, your fixed assets will be easy to move (or you make so much money that moving expenses are of no concern  to  you).

Computer  jobs  only  require  a  computer,  which  is  easily portable.

Also  consider  watch  repair,  micromechanics,  microelectronics, accounting, tax assistance, and other jobs that don't require heavy machinery.

Instead of moving the work home to your shelter, also consider moving your shelter  to  where  the  work  is.

Contractors  live  in  travel  trailers  that  they  pull around the country, living at low rents close to wherever the work is, and they use their work trucks to pull the trailer.
