As mentioned in Economic classifications, different types dominate a culture during  different  periods. 
正如[经济状态分类]()中所提到的，不同类型的文化在不同时期占据主导地位。
It's  possible  to  model  this  change  as  an  ecological succession  of  groups  of  four  different  agent  species--Renaissance  men, businessmen,  salary  men,  and  working  men--where  each  type  feeds  on  the culture created by the previous type, but, in turn, sets up the next dominant type, which eventually will suppress and dominate it. 
可以将这一变化建模为生态演替的媒介物种——文艺复兴人、生意人、薪资人和打工人——每种类型都以前一种类型创造的文化为食，但反过来又建立了下一种主导类型，最终将压制和支配前者。

In  nature,  succession  is  initiated  by  the  formation  of  new,  unoccupied habitat--for example, through lava flow, wildfires, or colonization. 
在自然界中，演替是由新的、无人居住的栖息地的形成开始的——例如，通过熔岩流、野火或殖民地。
If soil is not present, the barren land is first populated by pioneer plants like moss and lichen that can live in cracks, where water and dissolved minerals collect. 
如果没有土壤，贫瘠的土地首先会生长出苔藓和地衣等先锋植物，这些植物可以生长在裂缝中，水和溶解的矿物质聚集在裂缝中。
These plants break  down  the  rock  into  its  mineral  components  and  form  soil  when  they decompose. 
这些植物将岩石分解成矿物成分，并在分解时形成土壤。
The soil, whether already present or formed in the aforementioned process,  is  populated  with  annual  weeds,  which  also  die  and  contribute  to  the soil formation. 
土壤，无论是已经存在的还是在上述过程中形成的，都充满了一年生杂草，这些杂草会死亡并促进土壤的形成。
Subsequently, perennial weeds, shrubs, and small trees like aspen or pine take over in competition for resources like sunlight. 
随后，多年生杂草、灌木和小树（如白杨或松树）开始争夺阳光等资源。
Larger trees, like oak and elm, subsequently block the sunlight for the shorter trees, which die out, and thus the habitat finally reaches what is known as a climax stage or  community, which is stable, barring any disruptions such as forest fires or lava flows, which restart the cycle. 
较大的树木，如橡树和榆树，随后会阻挡较矮树木的阳光，而较矮的树木会消失，因此栖息地最终会达到所谓的高潮阶段或群落，这是稳定的，除非出现任何干扰，如森林火灾或熔岩流，从而重新开始循环。

For  an  example  of  succession  that  is  easier  to  relate  to  for  a  "civilized" person,  consider  how  cookie-cutter  housing  developments  easily  populate undeveloped  land,  like  weed  seeds. 
对于一个“文明”的人来说，演替的例子更容易理解，想想小饼干屋的发展过程如何快速填满未开发的土地，就像杂草种子。
These  dwellings  are  unable  to  survive without cars forming long roots back to shopping centers in the city. 
如果没有汽车在城市购物中心扎根，这些住宅将无法生存。
As suburbia takes  hold,  strip  malls  appear  closer  to  the  development. 
随着郊区的兴起，带状购物中心似乎离开发区越来越近。
These  draw  in  more people,  which  increases  the  price  of land and makes closer-spaced,  but higher- quality  homes  more  economical. 
这些措施吸引了更多的人，从而提高了土地价格，使空间更近，但质量更高的住房更经济。
This  in  turn  attracts  small  general  shops, eventually  forming  a  shopping  street  or  downtown  area. 
这反过来又吸引了小型普通商店，最终形成了一条购物街或商业区。
Sidewalks  appear, followed by multi-story buildings in the city center. 
人行道出现了，随后是市中心的多层建筑。
As the succession proceeds, old species like cars and sprawl are eliminated, eventually leading to the climax community of a city. 
随着演替的进行，像汽车和城市蔓延这样的古老物种被淘汰，最终形成一个城市的顶级社区。

The same thing occurs in the world of ideas. 
同样的事情也发生在思想世界中。
A group of people or a single person get a bright idea which is completely different from all other ideas. 
一个人或一群人得到了一个完全不同于其他想法的好主意。
If the idea  has  merit,  other  people  pick  up  the  idea  and  create  their  own  personal variations  on  the  idea,  perhaps  giving  different  names  to  the  same  object,  or perhaps using different methods to arrive at the same conclusion. 
如果这个想法有价值，其他人会接受这个想法，并根据这个想法创造自己的个人变体，可能给同一个对象起不同的名字，或者使用不同的方法得出相同的结论。
These people compete for dominance of their ideas, eventually reaching a point where only a handful of different methods are used. 
这些人争夺他们思想的主导地位，最终达到只使用少数几种不同方法的地步。
The next generation uses those methods to discover  new  details,  but  they  don't  compete  on  methodology,  and  hence  it remains  static. 
下一代人使用这些方法来发现新的细节，但它们在方法论上不存在竞争，因此它维持静态。
As  the  intellectual  field  matures,  the  rate  at  which  details  are discovered increases. 
随着知识领域的成熟，发现细节的速度也在加快。
As competition grows more intense, the scope of discovery narrows,  specialization  increases,  and  politics  becomes  increasingly  more important, as happens in any complex society where resources--in this case, the number of remaining discoveries to be made--are no longer abundant. 
随着竞争越来越激烈，发现的范围越来越窄，专业化程度越来越高，政治变得越来越重要，就像任何复杂的社会中所发生的那样，在这个社会中，资源——在本例中，剩余的发现数量——就会不再丰富。
The idea has  reached  its  climax  stage  a  point  where  no  new  understanding  occurs;  just increasingly smaller adjustments of the details. 
这个想法已经达到了没有新的理解出现的顶点；只是对细节的微小调整。

Some observations: 
一些观察结果：
Each "species" is adapted to thrive in a very specific environment. 
- 每一个“物种”都适应在一个非常特殊的环境中繁衍生息。
If  the  conditions  change,  the  existing  species  will  be  outcompeted  by  a species which is better adapted to the new conditions. 
- 如果环境发生变化，现有物种将被更能适应新环境的物种所超越。
Succession occurs because the dominance of one species gradually changes the environment. 
- 发生演替是因为一个优势物种逐渐改变了环境。

These  are  the  most  important  observations. 
这些是最重要的观察结果。
Keep  in  mind  that  one  species may  be  dependent  on  other  species  or  live  together  with  other  species  in communities. 
请记住，一个物种可能依赖于其他物种，或者与其他物种共同生活在群落中。
A  community  is  known  as  a  seral  stage. 
一个群落被称为一系列阶段。
Seral  stages  merge gradually into each other until they reach the climax stage. 
一系列阶段逐渐融合，直至达到高潮阶段。
The climax stage is stable, but may change due to external or internal disruptive events (lava flows, the invention of the steam engine).
高潮阶段是稳定的，但可能由于外部或内部破坏性事件（熔岩流，蒸汽机的发明）而改变。
