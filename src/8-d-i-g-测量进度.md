o  gauge  progress,  I  use  the  "overhead  pound."  This  is  a  weight  lifted  or cleaned from the ground or near the ground to the shoulder, "half overhead," and then getting it "overhead" with the arms straight. 

Moving a weight from shoulder to  waist  height  in  a  squat  is  a  "quarter  overhead."  The  distance  covered  for  a deadlift  is  also  considered  a  "quarter  overhead."  A  push-up  is  roughly  the distance  of  half  an  overhead,  but  since  the  feet  are  supporting  half  the bodyweight,  each  push-up  is  only  half  of  that. 

If  you  weigh  200  pounds,  one push  up  is  thus  50  overhead  pounds. 

You  will  find  that,  thus  scaled,  most compound movement work capacity tests lead to roughly the same numbers. 

The intensity of an "overhead" depends on the individual. 

Lifting a weight overhead requires more work for someone who is 6'2" than for someone who is 5'6." 


Compared  to  human  potential,88  a  good  measure  of  work  capacity  for  a  6- foot 175-pound male is being able to execute 5,000 overhead pounds within 10 minutes89 (this will make you quite competitive for local sports events); 10,000+ overhead pounds is a professional performance, and 2,500 is rather weak. 


Work  capacity  scales  by  bodyweight,  so  weighing  50%  more  means increasing  expected  capacity  by  50%. 

Since  male  athletes  are  about  25% stronger  than  females  athletes  pound  for  pound,  females  can  subtract  25%. 

Unfortunately  the  current  female  body  ideal  in  our  culture  is  somewhat emaciated,  and  consequently  women  find  themselves  doing  cardio  to  rid themselves  of  fat  and  muscle  and  working  out  with  five-pound  dumbbells  to "tone"  what's  left  of  the  muscles.90  This  is  strictly  a  cosmetic  preference. 

Functionally, if a 175-pound male is working out with 50 pound weights, a 125 pound  female  should  be  working  out  with  0.75×125/175  ×50  =  26  pound weights to be at the same level of fitness. 


At this level, participating in physical activities won't be limited by general physical  preparedness. 

Any  limit  will  be  sports-specific. 

For  instance,  your tendons and knees won't appreciate it if you decide to run a marathon tomorrow, but your heart, legs, and lungs will be up for the task. 

Similarly, if you should decide to take up a sport like tennis, martial arts, or swimming, it will only be a lack  of  sports-specific  technique  that  will  hold  you  back. 

You  should  pass  any fitness test by the military, police, fire department, etc. 

with flying colors.
