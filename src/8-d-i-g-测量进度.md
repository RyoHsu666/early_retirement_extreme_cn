To  gauge  progress,  I  use  the  "overhead  pound."  This  is  a  weight  lifted  or cleaned from the ground or near the ground to the shoulder, "half overhead," and then getting it "overhead" with the arms straight. 
为了衡量进度，我使用“overhead  pound”。这是从地面的重物举起或高翻到肩膀，“一半在头顶上”，然后伸直手臂举过“头顶”。
Moving a weight from shoulder to  waist  height  in  a  squat  is  a  "quarter  overhead."  The  distance  covered  for  a deadlift  is  also  considered  a  "quarter  overhead."  A  push-up  is  roughly  the distance  of  half  an  overhead,  but  since  the  feet  are  supporting  half  the bodyweight,  each  push-up  is  only  half  of  that. 
下蹲时，将重物从肩部移到腰部是“四分之一头顶”。无载升降机覆盖的距离也被视为“四分之一头顶”。俯卧撑的距离大约是头顶的一半，但由于双脚支撑着一半的体重，每次俯卧撑的距离仅为头顶的一半。
If  you  weigh  200  pounds,  one push  up  is  thus  50  overhead  pounds. 
如果你体重90公斤，那么一个俯卧撑就相当于头顶23公斤。
You  will  find  that,  thus  scaled,  most compound movement work capacity tests lead to roughly the same numbers. 
你会发现，按比例计算，大多数复合运动工作能力测试得出的数字大致相同。
The intensity of an "overhead" depends on the individual. 
“过头”的强度取决于个人。
Lifting a weight overhead requires more work for someone who is 6'2" than for someone who is 5'6." 
对于188cm的人来说，在头顶上举重比168cm的人需要更多的工作

Compared  to  human  potential,88  a  good  measure  of  work  capacity  for  a  6- foot 175-pound male is being able to execute 5,000 overhead pounds within 10 minutes89 (this will make you quite competitive for local sports events); 10,000+ overhead pounds is a professional performance, and 2,500 is rather weak. 
与人的潜能相比，衡量一个身高182厘米79公斤的男性的一个很好的标准是能够在10分钟内完成2267公斤的举重（这将使你在当地的体育赛事中相当有竞争力）；4535公斤以上的是一种职业表现，而1133则相对较弱。

Work  capacity  scales  by  bodyweight,  so  weighing  50%  more  means increasing  expected  capacity  by  50%. 
工作能力按体重来衡量，因此，体重增加50%意味着预期工作能力增加50%。
Since  male  athletes  are  about  25% stronger  than  females  athletes  pound  for  pound,  females  can  subtract  25%. 
由于男性运动员比女性运动员强壮25%，女性可以减去25%。
Unfortunately  the  current  female  body  ideal  in  our  culture  is  somewhat emaciated,  and  consequently  women  find  themselves  doing  cardio  to  rid themselves  of  fat  and  muscle  and  working  out  with  five-pound  dumbbells  to "tone"  what's  left  of  the  muscles.90  This  is  strictly  a  cosmetic  preference. 
不幸的是，在我们的文化中，目前的女性理想体型有点消瘦，因此女性发现自己在做有氧运动来消除脂肪和肌肉，并用2公斤重的哑铃来“调节”剩下的肌肉。这完全是一种化妆品偏好。
Functionally, if a 175-pound male is working out with 50 pound weights, a 125 pound  female  should  be  working  out  with  0.75×125/175  ×50  =  26  pound weights to be at the same level of fitness. 
从功能上来说，如果一个80公斤重的男性锻炼22公斤重，那么一个56公斤重的女性应该锻炼12公斤重，以达到相同的健身水平。

At this level, participating in physical activities won't be limited by general physical  preparedness. 
在这个水平上，参加体育活动不会受到一般身体状态的限制。
Any  limit  will  be  sports-specific. 
任何限制都将因运动而异。
For  instance,  your tendons and knees won't appreciate it if you decide to run a marathon tomorrow, but your heart, legs, and lungs will be up for the task. 
例如，如果你决定明天参加马拉松比赛，你的肌腱和膝盖将无法承受，但你的心脏、腿和肺将为这项任务做好准备。
Similarly, if you should decide to take up a sport like tennis, martial arts, or swimming, it will only be a lack  of  sports-specific  technique  that  will  hold  you  back. 
同样地，如果你决定从事网球、武术或游泳等运动，那只会是缺乏特定的运动技巧而让你望而却步。
You  should  pass  any fitness test by the military, police, fire department, etc. 
你应该通过军队、警察、消防部门等的健康测试。
with flying colors.
并取得优异成绩。
