Spend much time reading about budgets or engaging in discussions about
lifestyles and you'll notice that most of them focus on the difference between
needs  and  wants.  

花费大量世界来阅读关于预算或者参与生活方式的讨论，你会反向它们大多数是关注需要和响应的不同。

This  often  results  in  normative  discussions  of  what  other
people  should  need  or  want,  which  usually  degenerate  into  discussions  about
what is possible and what is not possible.

在常规的讨论中结果经常是他人应该需要和想要，这经常退化成什么是可能的和什么是不可能的。

The  fact  that  it  is  so  hard  to  agree  on  which  is  which  suggests  that  the
differentiation has become meaningless and thus irrelevant.

事实是争论哪个是哪个是非常困难的，建议的不同会变得无意义和不相关。

There are no such things as needs and wants.

没有即想要又需要的东西。

It's therefore pointless to argue about the difference or make lists of needs
and wants. 

争论其中的不同是和列出想要和需要的清单是没有意义的。

The problem is that needs and wants don't fit on two different lists.

问题是想要和需要不适合两个不同的列表。

They fit on one list where they're ranked according to value rather than price (see
Economical).

它们适合一个根据价值而不是价格排列的列表（参见经济）。

 Needs and wants are different in degree, not in kind.

想要和需要是程度上的不同，而不是类别上的不同。

Consider, for example, shelter. Here the list of choices may look like this:

考虑一下，例如，庇护所。可选的列表看起来像这样：

1.  Sleeping under open air.

1. 谁在露天下。

2.  Sleeping under a tarp, basha, or hootchie.

2. 睡在防水布下，basha帐下（A形天幕，四角固定到地面），或者hootchie帐下（A形天幕，四角悬空固定）。

3.  Living in a tent.

3. 生活在帐篷里。

4.  Couch surfing.

4. 沙发客。

5.  Living in a shack or a cabin.

5. 生活在棚子里或者小木屋里。

6.  Living in a ship cabin or truck cab.

6. 生活在船舱或者卡车驾驶室里。

7.  Living in a car or a boat.

7. 生活在车里或者船里。

8.  Living in an RV.

8. 生活在野营车里

9.  Sharing a room with other people.
9. 和其他人共享房间。
10.  Having your own room.
10. 有你自己的房间。
11.  Sharing an apartment with other people.
11. 和其他人共享公寓。
12.  Having your own apartment.
12. 拥有你自己的公寓。
13.  Sharing a house with other people.
13. 和他人共享房子。
14.  ...
14. ……


On this scale there is no demarcation of when a need becomes a want. 

在这种尺度上没有什么时候需要变成想要的界限。

Each
step is slightly different and slightly more expensive than the previous step, with
no clear indication of what the bare minimum is, other than having somewhere
to sleep. 

每一阶和上一阶不一样也更贵，但是对于在某个地方睡觉来说，没有清晰的指示说什么是最简的。

At what point, then, does a want become a need?

在哪个点上，使想要变成了需要？

It could be argued that sleeping under open air in Alaska or Finland will kill
you, and that some form of shelter is therefore a need. 

这可能会引发争论说在阿拉斯加或者芬兰露天睡觉会冻死人，那一些形式的避难所就变成了需要了。

However, it's possible for
people living in Finland or Alaska to move south so shelter isn't an absolute
need. 

然而，生活在芬兰或阿拉斯加的人可以搬到南方去，所以庇护所也不是绝对需要的。

Rather, it's shelter in Finland or Alaska that is an absolute need--insofar
that staying alive is a need, but nobody needs to live in Finland or Alaska, even
though I'm sure those are nice places.45
Even though the rankings on this list probably match the rankings of most
people, it's by no means universal. Having experienced the freedom of living in
an RV or a boat for a while, some people would never dream of substituting this
for a 4,000square-foot McMansion with its endless cleaning and maintenance
issues, and the need for walkie-talkies to find lost family members. The list is
individual,  because  any  choice  has  consequences  in  other  domains  (see
Contingency goal-setting).
For each individual, there are similar lists for eating, clothing, transportation,
health, time, tools, toys, activities, status, etc., each ranging from essentially zero
cost to more than one can imagine. These can also be classified into tangibles
like  air,  water,  food,  sanitary,  shelter,  communication,  transport,  health,  and
security,  and  intangibles,  like  time,  relationships,  affiliation,  power,  and

achievement. Some of these, like security and sanitation, we take for granted
living in the developed world. For others, except perhaps air and clean water,
there's a large range of possible "consumption" levels. For instance, the eating
list ranges from roadkill and dumpster diving, to industrially processed "food,"
to gourmet meals and fine dining. Clothing ranges from going naked to owning
just one set of clothes, to owning massive wardrobes full of shoes and tailor-
made suits. Transportation ranges from walking barefoot to driving a "hooptie,"
to private airplanes and megayachts. Health ranges from being strong (physically
and mentally), to being on prescription medicines, to being entirely dependent
on advanced medical infrastructure. Time ranges from being a galley slave, to
working 8-10-hour days in a tolerable job, to doing what you want, which may
or may not include what is otherwise classified as work.
Completing these lists is left as an exercise for the reader. In fact, such an
exercise is highly recommended. Try to make it as wide-ranging as possible and
as complete as possible. It may range wider and include more dimensions than
suggested above.
Each level on each list has a price and a value which is individually unique.
The ultimate goal is maximizing total value while minimizing the total price.
While the locked-in lifestyle described in The lock-in provides a default choice
of  levels,  it's  possible  to  choose  one's  levels  very  differently.  For  instance,
instead of choosing a career in a cubicle, a five-bedroom/three-bathroom home
on  a  30-year  mortgage,  and  a  new  TV  on  credit,  one  may  choose  financial
independence and early retirement.
