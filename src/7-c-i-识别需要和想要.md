Spend much time reading about budgets or engaging in discussions about
lifestyles and you'll notice that most of them focus on the difference between
needs  and  wants.  

花费大量世界来阅读关于预算或者参与生活方式的讨论，你会反向它们大多数是关注需要和响应的不同。

This  often  results  in  normative  discussions  of  what  other
people  should  need  or  want,  which  usually  degenerate  into  discussions  about
what is possible and what is not possible.

在常规的讨论中结果经常是他人应该需要和想要，这经常退化成什么是可能的和什么是不可能的。

The  fact  that  it  is  so  hard  to  agree  on  which  is  which  suggests  that  the
differentiation has become meaningless and thus irrelevant.

事实是争论哪个是哪个是非常困难的，建议的不同会变得无意义和不相关。

There are no such things as needs and wants.

没有即想要又需要的东西。

It's therefore pointless to argue about the difference or make lists of needs
and wants. 

争论其中的不同是和列出想要和需要的清单是没有意义的。

The problem is that needs and wants don't fit on two different lists.



They fit on one list where they're ranked according to value rather than price (see
Economical).



 Needs and wants are different in degree, not in kind.

Consider, for example, shelter. Here the list of choices may look like this:
1.  Sleeping under open air.
2.  Sleeping under a tarp, basha, or hootchie.
3.  Living in a tent.
4.  Couch surfing.
5.  Living in a shack or a cabin.
6.  Living in a ship cabin or truck cab.
7.  Living in a car or a boat.
8.  Living in an RV.
9.  Sharing a room with other people.
10.  Having your own room.
11.  Sharing an apartment with other people.
12.  Having your own apartment.
13.  Sharing a house with other people.
14.  ...

On this scale there is no demarcation of when a need becomes a want. Each
step is slightly different and slightly more expensive than the previous step, with
no clear indication of what the bare minimum is, other than having somewhere
to sleep. At what point, then, does a want become a need?
It could be argued that sleeping under open air in Alaska or Finland will kill
you, and that some form of shelter is therefore a need. However, it's possible for
people living in Finland or Alaska to move south so shelter isn't an absolute
need. Rather, it's shelter in Finland or Alaska that is an absolute need--insofar
that staying alive is a need, but nobody needs to live in Finland or Alaska, even
though I'm sure those are nice places.45
Even though the rankings on this list probably match the rankings of most
people, it's by no means universal. Having experienced the freedom of living in
an RV or a boat for a while, some people would never dream of substituting this
for a 4,000square-foot McMansion with its endless cleaning and maintenance
issues, and the need for walkie-talkies to find lost family members. The list is
individual,  because  any  choice  has  consequences  in  other  domains  (see
Contingency goal-setting).
For each individual, there are similar lists for eating, clothing, transportation,
health, time, tools, toys, activities, status, etc., each ranging from essentially zero
cost to more than one can imagine. These can also be classified into tangibles
like  air,  water,  food,  sanitary,  shelter,  communication,  transport,  health,  and
security,  and  intangibles,  like  time,  relationships,  affiliation,  power,  and

achievement. Some of these, like security and sanitation, we take for granted
living in the developed world. For others, except perhaps air and clean water,
there's a large range of possible "consumption" levels. For instance, the eating
list ranges from roadkill and dumpster diving, to industrially processed "food,"
to gourmet meals and fine dining. Clothing ranges from going naked to owning
just one set of clothes, to owning massive wardrobes full of shoes and tailor-
made suits. Transportation ranges from walking barefoot to driving a "hooptie,"
to private airplanes and megayachts. Health ranges from being strong (physically
and mentally), to being on prescription medicines, to being entirely dependent
on advanced medical infrastructure. Time ranges from being a galley slave, to
working 8-10-hour days in a tolerable job, to doing what you want, which may
or may not include what is otherwise classified as work.
Completing these lists is left as an exercise for the reader. In fact, such an
exercise is highly recommended. Try to make it as wide-ranging as possible and
as complete as possible. It may range wider and include more dimensions than
suggested above.
Each level on each list has a price and a value which is individually unique.
The ultimate goal is maximizing total value while minimizing the total price.
While the locked-in lifestyle described in The lock-in provides a default choice
of  levels,  it's  possible  to  choose  one's  levels  very  differently.  For  instance,
instead of choosing a career in a cubicle, a five-bedroom/three-bathroom home
on  a  30-year  mortgage,  and  a  new  TV  on  credit,  one  may  choose  financial
independence and early retirement.
