Strategy,  tactics,  and  guiding principles The  development  of  a  strategy  follows  the  progression  given  in  Gauging mastery--copying -> comparing -> compiling -> computing -> coordinating  -> creating,  and  parallels  the  development  of  expertise. 
战略、战术和指导原则战略的制定，遵循[衡量精通]()的过程——复制->比较->编译->计算->协调->创造，并与专业知识的发展平行。
The  first  two  levels, copying and comparing, correspond to defining an objective--that is, a goal, such as  getting  out  of  debt,  becoming  a  millionaire,  retiring  early,  or  running  a marathon. 
前两个层次，复制和比较，对应于定义一个目标——即一个目标，如摆脱债务、成为百万富翁、提前退休或跑马拉松。
The  next  two  levels,  compiling  and  computing,  correspond  to following a plan, which is a sequence of individual actions or tactics ("tips" in personal  finance  parlance). 
接下来的两个层次，编译和计算，对应于遵循一个计划，这是一系列个人行动或策略（个人理财术语中的“提示”）。
Don't  confuse  a  plan  with  a  strategy. 
不要把计划和战略混为一谈。
sequence  of actions, but it  doesn't describe the guiding principles. 
一个计划包括一个目标和一系列行动，但它没有描述指导原则。
A  plan comprises a goal and a A  strategy  requires  all  three  ingredients  and  thus  requires coordination and creativity. 
战略需要所有三个要素，因此需要协调和创造性。

Now, there are many plans available on the market following a permutation of a formula of the type, "X days/tips to success in Y using the Z method," where X is a number (typically 7, 21, 30, or 365 days or 10, 12, 50, or 100 tips), Y is something  desirable  (typically  $1,000,000,  losing  weight,  getting  a  date,  etc.), and Z is some kind of secret or, often, the author's autobiography. 
现在，市场上有许多可用的计划，其类型为“X天使用Z方法在Y中成功的秘诀”，其中X是一个数字（通常为7、21、30或365天或10、12、50或100个秘诀），Y是理想的东西（通常为1000000美元、减肥、约会等），Z是某种秘密，通常是作者的自传。
A plan can be thought  of  as  a  sequential  set  of  instructions. 
一个计划可以被看作是一组连续的指令。
"If  you  do  this,  followed  by  this and that, and several additional steps, you'll end up at the goal." 
“如果你这样做，然后这样那样做，再加上几个额外的步骤，你就会达到目标。”

Plans work well if the number of degrees of freedom (see Economic degrees of freedom) is limited so that few things can go wrong--that is, not according to plan. 
如果自由度（见[经济上的自由度]()）的数量受到限制，很少会出差错，那么计划就可以很好地运作——也就是说，不按照计划进行。
However,  the  more  complex  the  situation--and  life  is  generally  more complex than assembling a piece of Swedish furniture--the greater the chance of something going wrong due to 
然而，情况越复杂——生活通常比组装一件瑞典家具更复杂——发生故障的可能性就越大，因为

unknown unknowns--uncertain factors that nobody is aware of, also known as surprises, 
- 未知的未知——无人知晓的不确定因素，也称为意外，
unknown  knowns--certain  factors  that  you're  not  aware  of,  meaning  that you got the wrong plan, also known as "I told you so", 
- 未知知识——某些你不知道的因素，意味着你的计划错了，也就是“我告诉过你的”，
known unknowns--uncertain factors that you are aware of, meaning that the plan is correct but lacking precision, also known as bad luck or bad design. 
- 已知的未知因素——你知道的不确定因素，意味着计划是正确的，但缺乏精确性，也被称为坏运气或坏设计。

The  construction  of  a  plan--that  is,  the  way  the  tactics  are  coordinated  and created--follows  a  set  of  guiding  principles. 
计划的制定——即战术的协调和创造方式——遵循一套指导原则。
If  a  plan  shows  how  to  put instructions  together,  then  guiding  principles  show  how  to  put  a  plan  together and  create  a  strategy. 
如果一个计划展示了如何将指令组合在一起，那么指导原则则展示了如何将一个计划组合在一起并创建一个战略。
Strategic thinking--that is, the creation of plans--is what separates the last two levels, coordinating and creating, from the first four levels. 
战略思维——即计划的制定——是将最后两个层次（协调和创造）与前四个层次分开的。
Compared to a plan, which may be thought of as a string of actions, subject to complete failure if it breaks, a strategy is better thought of as a web of actions. 

A web does not fail catastrophically if it's cut in a single, or even a few places. 

It's resilient, whereas a plan is not. 

This is why having a strategy is much preferred to  having  a  plan. 

 A  web  comprises  and  connects  a  person's  thoughts,  ideas, experiences,  memories,  goals,  values,  desires,  connections,  assets,  liabilities, predictions  and  expectations. 

 Here,  a  larger  inventory  of  the  aforementioned means  there's  a  greater  variety  of  possible  strategies  and  that  any  given  plan becomes more flexible. 

Focusing solely on the coordination aspect and ignoring the  tactics  can  result  in  "clueless  manager  syndrome."  Conversely,  focusing solely  on  the  knowledge  of  tactics  or  skills  described  in  Human  capital  and necessary  personal  assets  would  only  produce  a  person  with  a  multitude  of hobbies. 

 Only  the  combination  of  skills  and  coordination  will  unleash  the creativity  of  an  expert. 

 Creative  synthesis  occurs  when  you're  able  to  see principles as an abstract model representation and apply the abstracted model elsewhere. 

With experience, you'll see that the number of such models in the world  is  actually  quite  limited. 

 What  this  means  is  that  any  kind  of  human understanding is based on a small number of representations that are repeated over and over. 

Perhaps this is because humans are only capable of thinking in certain limited ways, so the same methods are discovered independently over and  over  by  successful  experts  in  different  fields,  or  perhaps  experts tend  to borrow  from  each  other,  seeking  inspiration  elsewhere;  it  is  probably  a combination. 

This means that one doesn't need another 10,000 hours to become an expert in another field, even if it's only marginally related. 

It means that it's easier to master several different fields than is commonly assumed. 


It's important to understand that doing the right thing (good strategy) is much more important than doing things right (good tactics). 

This is why this book is short on tactics and long on strategies. 

Strategy is about defining the end-goals. 

Tactics  is  about  the  means  to  those  ends. 

 One  thing  that  was  crucial  in formulating the strategy towards a Renaissance life with financial independence was that the means be widely available. 

A strategy that relies on means that are impossible to replicate for most people, like inheriting $1 million, winning the lottery,  being  the  rare  inventor  or  author  that  actually  gets  his  great  ideas commercialized, being the first one in on a new technology, or simply riding a leveraged asset in a financial bubble and getting out at the right time, or relying on yet-to-exist communities or ways of life, are not very effective. 

For fear of repeating myself and boring the reader, the strategy is what is going to create success  and  it  is  to  a  large  extent  what  separates  successful  people  from unsuccessful  people. 

 The  tactics,  less  so,  as  most  are  capable  of  good performance on the tactical level. 


For progress, it's essential to base goals on a consistent strategy that guides individual tactics (see Ergodicity and destiny). 

 There's  more  than  one  way  to spin a strategic web and some ways are better than others. 

Given a capable and intelligent person or group of people, errors rarely originate in the execution of a plan,  though  the  plan  itself  may  fail. 

 Instead,  errors  occur  in  the  principles underlying the development of the plan. 

Therefore, it's important to base a plan or a framework on the correct principles. 


Consider again the different types in this figure. 

Each type is characterized by  very  different  strategies. 

 As  indicated  in  the  diagram,  the  Renaissance strategy is based on a combination of consilience--a specific way of weaving widely  different  tools  and  ideas  together  to  solve  complex  problems--and resilience, which is based on the principles of modularity, diversity, and slack (loosely  coupled  feedback  processes). 

 Resilience  is  the  foundation  of  most behaviors observed in nature. 

After all, if they weren't resilient, they would be extinct. 

While not completely equivalent, consilience shares a lot with typical businesses  strategies  which  can  be  transferred  to  the  individual  sphere. 

Combining resilience  and  consilience  defines  the  Renaissance  man,  and  they will be used in A  Renaissance  lifestyle  to  form  a  complete  strategy  that  will make a committed person financially independent in a handful of years.
