The  development  of  a  strategy  follows  the  progression  given  in  Gauging
mastery

策略的发展轨迹在“衡量精通”中已经给出了，

--copying -> comparing -> compiling -> computing -> coordinating ->
creating,  

复制 -> 比较 -> 编译 -> 计算 -> 定位 -> 创造，


and  parallels  the  development  of  expertise.  

这也是专家的发展轨迹。

The  first  two  levels,
copying and comparing, correspond to defining an objective--that is, a goal, such
as  getting  out  of  debt,  becoming  a  millionaire,  retiring  early,  or  running  a
marathon.  

开始的两级，复制和比较，对应的是定义一个实体——也就是，一个目标，例如，从摆脱债务、成为百万富翁、早退休或者跑个马拉松。

The  next  two  levels,  compiling  and  computing,  correspond  to
following a plan, which is a sequence of individual actions or tactics ("tips" in
personal  finance  parlance). 

下两个层级，编译和比较，对应的是遵从计划，就是一系列的单独的行动或战术（个人财务用语中的“小提示”）。

 Don't  confuse  a  plan  with  a  strategy.  
 
 别把计划混淆为战术。
 
 A  plan
comprises a goal and a sequence of actions, but it doesn't describe the guiding
principles. 

一个计划融合了目的和一系列行动，但是它不描述指导原则。

 A  strategy  requires  all  three  ingredients  and  thus  requires
coordination and creativity.

一个策略要求所有三个材料，也要求定位和创造力。


Now, there are many plans available on the market following a permutation
of a formula of the type, 

当下，市场上有很多公式性质的计划，

"X days/tips to success in Y using the Z method," where
X is a number (typically 7, 21, 30, or 365 days or 10, 12, 50, or 100 tips), Y is
something desirable (typically $1,000,000, losing weight, getting a date, etc.),
and Z is some kind of secret or, often, the author's autobiography.

“在Y中用Z方法X天/个提示就能成功 ”，这里 X 是数量（通常是7，21，30，或365天，或者10，12，50，或100个小提示），

 A plan can be
thought of as a sequential set of instructions.

一个计划能够被认为是一系列之时的集合。

 "If you do this, followed by this
and that, and several additional steps, you'll end up at the goal."

“如果你做这个，跟随这个或那个，再附加额外的步骤，你就会达成目标。”

Plans work well if the number of degrees of freedom (see Economic degrees
of freedom) is limited so that few things can go wrong--that is, not according to
plan. 

如果自由度（参加经济上的自由度）数量受限制，没有事情会出错，计划运行的很好，也就是，不是根据计划来的。

 However,  the  more  complex  the  situation--and  life  is  generally  more
complex than assembling a piece of Swedish furniture--the greater the chance of
something going wrong due to
unknown unknowns--uncertain factors that nobody is aware of,

然而，对于更复杂的情况——生活远比组装一个瑞士家具要复杂——那就由于未知的未知很大机会上事情会出错——不确定的因素没有注意的到，

 also known
as surprises,

也叫做惊喜，

unknown  knowns--certain  factors  that  you're  not  aware  of,  meaning  that
you got the wrong plan, also known as "I told you so",

未知的已知——当然是你没注意到的，也意味着你做着错的计划，通常叫做“我早跟你说过”，


known unknowns--uncertain factors that you are aware of, meaning that the
plan is correct but lacking precision, also known as bad luck or bad design.

已知的未知——你注意到的不确定的因素，意味着计划正确但是缺乏精度，通常叫运气差或者没设计好。

The construction of a plan--that is, the way the tactics are coordinated and

created--follows  a  set  of  guiding  principles.  

构建一个计划——就是遵循定位创造出来的一系列战术——一系列指导原则跟随。

If  a  plan  shows  how  to  put
instructions together, then guiding principles show how to put a plan together
and create a strategy. 



Strategic thinking--that is, the creation of plans--is what
separates the last two levels, coordinating and creating, from the first four levels.
Compared to a plan, which may be thought of as a string of actions, subject to
complete failure if it breaks, a strategy is better thought of as a web of actions. A
web does not fail catastrophically if it's cut in a single, or even a few places. It's
resilient, whereas a plan is not. This is why having a strategy is much preferred
to  having  a  plan.  A  web  comprises  and  connects  a  person's  thoughts,  ideas,
experiences,  memories,  goals,  values,  desires,  connections,  assets,  liabilities,
predictions  and  expectations.  Here,  a  larger  inventory  of  the  aforementioned
means  there's  a  greater  variety  of  possible  strategies  and  that  any  given  plan
becomes more flexible. Focusing solely on the coordination aspect and ignoring
the  tactics  can  result  in  "clueless  manager  syndrome."  Conversely,  focusing
solely  on  the  knowledge  of  tactics  or  skills  described  in  Human  capital  and
necessary  personal  assets  would  only  produce  a  person  with  a  multitude  of
hobbies.  Only  the  combination  of  skills  and  coordination  will  unleash  the
creativity  of  an  expert.  Creative  synthesis  occurs  when  you're  able  to  see
principles as an abstract model representation and apply the abstracted model
elsewhere. With experience, you'll see that the number of such models in the
world  is  actually  quite  limited.  What  this  means  is  that  any  kind  of  human
understanding is based on a small number of representations that are repeated
over and over. Perhaps this is because humans are only capable of thinking in
certain limited ways, so the same methods are discovered independently over
and  over  by  successful  experts  in  different  fields,  or  perhaps  experts tend  to
borrow  from  each  other,  seeking  inspiration  elsewhere;  it  is  probably  a
combination. This means that one doesn't need another 10,000 hours to become
an expert in another field, even if it's only marginally related. It means that it's
easier to master several different fields than is commonly assumed.
It's important to understand that doing the right thing (good strategy) is much
more important than doing things right (good tactics). This is why this book is
short on tactics and long on strategies. Strategy is about defining the end-goals.
Tactics  is  about  the  means  to  those  ends.  One  thing  that  was  crucial  in
formulating the strategy towards a Renaissance life with financial independence
was that the means be widely available. A strategy that relies on means that are
impossible to replicate for most people, like inheriting $1 million, winning the
lottery,  being  the  rare  inventor  or  author  that  actually  gets  his  great  ideas
commercialized, being the first one in on a new technology, or simply riding a
leveraged asset in a financial bubble and getting out at the right time, or relying

on yet-to-exist communities or ways of life, are not very effective. For fear of
repeating myself and boring the reader, the strategy is what is going to create
success  and  it  is  to  a  large  extent  what  separates  successful  people  from
unsuccessful  people.  The  tactics,  less  so,  as  most  are  capable  of  good
performance on the tactical level.
For progress, it's essential to base goals on a consistent strategy that guides
individual tactics (see Ergodicity and destiny).  There's  more  than  one  way  to
spin a strategic web and some ways are better than others. Given a capable and
intelligent person or group of people, errors rarely originate in the execution of a
plan,  though  the  plan  itself  may  fail.  Instead,  errors  occur  in  the  principles
underlying the development of the plan. Therefore, it's important to base a plan
or a framework on the correct principles.
Consider again the different types in this figure. Each type is characterized
by  very  different  strategies.  As  indicated  in  the  diagram,  the  Renaissance
strategy is based on a combination of consilience--a specific way of weaving
widely  different  tools  and  ideas  together  to  solve  complex  problems--and
resilience, which is based on the principles of modularity, diversity, and slack
(loosely  coupled  feedback  processes).  Resilience  is  the  foundation  of  most
behaviors observed in nature. After all, if they weren't resilient, they would be
extinct. While not completely equivalent, consilience shares a lot with typical
businesses  strategies  which  can  be  transferred  to  the  individual  sphere.
Combining resilience  and  consilience  defines  the  Renaissance  man,  and  they
will be used in A  Renaissance  lifestyle  to  form  a  complete  strategy  that  will
make a committed person financially independent in a handful of years.
