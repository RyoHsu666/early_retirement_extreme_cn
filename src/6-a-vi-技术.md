Thanks  to  specialization,  the  average  person  uses  many  more  kinds  of technology  than  he  actually  understands. 

 This  lack  of  understanding  makes  us unable  to  distinguish  quality  and  allows  marketing  and  slogans  to  influence purchases. 

As a result, people frequently end up with products and tools that are either  less  than  optimal  or  just  plain  unsuitable. 

 This  leads  to  frustration  and additional purchases, and allows the experts to charge more for what should be simple  operations. 

 In  addition,  technology  often  replaces  what  used  to  be considered a skill. 

For instance, some people no longer know how to boil an egg thanks to the invention of the automatic egg boiler. 

On top of that, consider how many other life skills have been lost during our transformation from craftsmen to technology  users. 

 Not  only  does  this  leave  us  without  the  ability  to  solve  the simplest  problem  when  something  breaks  down;  it  also  leads  to  enormous dependence  on  experts  and  specialists,  and  thus  on  an  income  to  pay  for  their services,  completing  the  circle. 

 It's  commonly  thought  that  independence  is mainly achieved through a large income. 

Rather than working to establish such a large income, it can, however, just as easily be gained by acquiring skills instead.
