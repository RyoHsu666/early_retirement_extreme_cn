The difference between the businessman and the working man or the salary man  is  that  the  cash  flow,  which  is  directly  associated  with  the  personal consumption of the businessman, is just a fraction of the total business cash flow he  controls.

The  money  under  control  is  typically  retained  earnings  from operations, paid-in capital, or simply borrowed from other investors.

Hence, the businessman sets up a business by using a combination of his own and other people's  savings--that  is,  other  people's  money  (OPM,  pronounced  "opium").

This  business  may  take  many  forms,  from  owning  a  rental  home  to  sole proprietorships  and  partnerships,  to  corporations  of  various  sizes.

A  business generates cash flow by converting assets into income.

The businessman inserts himself into this cash flow.

By being in control of more than just his own time and energy, he controls more cash flow and thus earns more.

Some businessmen create jobs by putting together assets and resources in a structure that is profitable, making it possible for workers to earn a wage.

This combination creates a solution to a problem in the form of a product that can be sold.

The problems are typically those of consumers, who buy the businessman's products, but they could also be problems related to government,  military,  or other business operations.

The cycle has thus come full circle.

The salary man and the working man spend all their time working and little of their time solving complex problems using assets.

This kind of problem-solving is done by the businessman in return for profit.

However, the businessman still relies on other people to turn assets into profit as well as for his income.

Profit generation is complicated by the presence of competitors, who tend to drive down returns and decrease profit margins.

Decreased profit margins mean that the businessman has to use leverage or become much more competitive to keep making a profit.

This leverage is obtained by using OPM to increase the size of the cycle, thus resulting in a tight coupling of the business cash flow.

If something  in  the  cycle  fails,  it  doesn't  take  much  to  significantly  impact  the profit margin.

The slack in this system is given by equity, which is the slack between  assets  and  liabilities  (debt)  in  the  cycle.

The  smaller  the  equity  is relative to the assets and the earnings, the more vulnerable the business is to perturbations  of  the  cycle  and  the  higher  the  returns  or  losses  will  be.

Competition may therefore require the businessman to restructure his operations, diverting  cash  flows  elsewhere  as  parts  of  the  operation  are  "creatively destroyed.

" While a lot of value can be destroyed, the broad industry knowledge survives to a large extent.

For instance, with the introduction of new technology or the decline of rental income in certain neighborhoods, the structural knowledge of the  businessman  remains  the  same,  as  do  most  of  the  procedures  of  doing business.

Only the assets are replaced.

In a recession, the procedures of doing business  may  change--some  specialists  (assets)  may  be  laid  off,  but  the technology remains the same.

In the figure, this situation would correspond to shifting  the  generalist  curve  a  bit.

Unlike  for  the  specialist,  shifting  the generalist's curve still leaves substantial overlap with the market.

The risk of the complex-coupled  businessman  is  thus  not  of  losing  his  job,  as  it  is  for  the specialist,  because  in  principle  the  businessman  doesn't  have  a  job,  and  he'll always be able to work.

His risk is in the loss of profit, as profit depends on customers buying his products.

In that sense, companies owe their existence to consumers (see Foundations of economics and finance).

Unlike the salary man and the working man, the businessman doesn't risk losing his job, though he does risk losing his business.

Like an exuberant artist or scientist, he is internally driven towards finding solutions and he does not wait for employment to start working--the businessman is an entrepreneur.

The risk for the businessman comes from the tight coupling between  shareholders  and bond holders on one side and consumers and workers on the other side, all of whom  must  be  satisfied  with  the  businessman  in  the  middle,  lest  capital  and profits vanish.

Some companies reduce this risk by having no long-term debt or by having special classes of shares.

Others reduce it by having many customers or  clients  or  easy  access  to  labor,  either  by  outsourcing,  offering  attractive benefits or simply due to an abundance of workers in a given field.

However, as long as there is a drive for profit, there will be competition and innovation, and those  risks  are  hard  to  eliminate  without  monopoly  pricing  power,  political favors, and other barriers to entry.

Since profit is the income of the businessman, and since the businessman needs income to buy stuff for himself, he too is at risk.

Many businessmen and entrepreneurs take steps similar to employees and establish emergency funds (see The working man).

However, those that desire to retire early either need to earn a lot of money fast or find an alternative solution
