The difference between the businessman and the working man or the salary man  is  that  the  cash  flow,  which  is  directly  associated  with  the  personal consumption of the businessman, is just a fraction of the total business cash flow he  controls.
商人与工人或领薪人的区别在于，与商人个人消费直接相关的现金流只是他控制的总商业现金流的一小部分。
The  money  under  control  is  typically  retained  earnings  from operations, paid-in capital, or simply borrowed from other investors.
控制下的资金通常是运营留存收益、实收资本或从其他投资者处借入的资金。
Hence, the businessman sets up a business by using a combination of his own and other people's  savings--that  is,  other  people's  money  (OPM,  pronounced  "opium").
因此，商人利用自己和其他人的储蓄——也就是其他人的钱（OPM，发音为“鸦片”）来建立企业。
This  business  may  take  many  forms,  from  owning  a  rental  home  to  sole proprietorships  and  partnerships,  to  corporations  of  various  sizes.
这项业务可以采取多种形式，从拥有出租房屋到独资和合伙企业，再到各种规模的公司。
A  business generates cash flow by converting assets into income.
企业通过将资产转换为收入来产生现金流。
The businessman inserts himself into this cash flow.
商人将自己插入到这个现金流中。
By being in control of more than just his own time and energy, he controls more cash flow and thus earns more.
不仅仅是通过控制自己的时间和精力，他可以控制更多的现金流，从而获得更多的收入。

Some businessmen create jobs by putting together assets and resources in a structure that is profitable, making it possible for workers to earn a wage.
一些商人通过将资产和资源集中在一个有利可图的结构中创造就业机会，使工人赚取工资成可能。
This combination creates a solution to a problem in the form of a product that can be sold.
这种组合把问题解决方案创造成了一种可以销售的产品。
The problems are typically those of consumers, who buy the businessman's products, but they could also be problems related to government,  military,  or other business operations.
这些问题通常是那些购买商人产品的消费者的问题，但也可能是与政府、军队或其他商业运营有关的问题。

The cycle has thus come full circle.
这一循环已经闭环了。
The salary man and the working man spend all their time working and little of their time solving complex problems using assets.
领薪人和工人把所有的时间都花在工作上，很少有时间用资产解决复杂的问题。
This kind of problem-solving is done by the businessman in return for profit.
这种解决问题的方法是商人为了利润而做的。
However, the businessman still relies on other people to turn assets into profit as well as for his income.
然而，这位商人仍然依靠其他人将资产转化为利润和收入。

Profit generation is complicated by the presence of competitors, who tend to drive down returns and decrease profit margins.
竞争对手的存在使产生利润变得复杂，对手往往会降低回报率，降低利润率。
Decreased profit margins mean that the businessman has to use leverage or become much more competitive to keep making a profit.
利润率下降意味着商人必须利用杠杆或变得更具竞争力来保持盈利。
This leverage is obtained by using OPM to increase the size of the cycle, thus resulting in a tight coupling of the business cash flow.
这种杠杆作用是通过使用OPM来增加循环的大小，从而导致业务现金流的紧密耦合。
If something  in  the  cycle  fails,  it  doesn't  take  much  to  significantly  impact  the profit margin.
如果循环中有什么东西失败了，它不会对利润率产生太大的影响。
The slack in this system is given by equity, which is the slack between  assets  and  liabilities  (debt)  in  the  cycle.
该系统中的松弛度由权益给出，权益是循环中资产和负债（债务）之间的松弛度。
The  smaller  the  equity  is relative to the assets and the earnings, the more vulnerable the business is to perturbations  of  the  cycle  and  the  higher  the  returns  or  losses  will  be.
权益相对于资产和收益的比例越小，企业就越容易受到循环扰动的影响，回报或损失也就越高。
Competition may therefore require the businessman to restructure his operations, diverting  cash  flows  elsewhere  as  parts  of  the  operation  are  "creatively destroyed.
因此，竞争可能要求商人重组其业务，将现金流转移到其他地方，因为业务的一部分被“创造性地破坏”。

" While a lot of value can be destroyed, the broad industry knowledge survives to a large extent.
虽然许多价值可能会被摧毁，但广泛的行业知识在很大程度上得以保存。
For instance, with the introduction of new technology or the decline of rental income in certain neighborhoods, the structural knowledge of the  businessman  remains  the  same,  as  do  most  of  the  procedures  of  doing business.
例如，随着新技术的引进或某些街区租金收入的下降，商人的结构知识保持一致，大多数做生意的程序也一样。
Only the assets are replaced.
只有资产被替换。
In a recession, the procedures of doing business  may  change--some  specialists  (assets)  may  be  laid  off,  but  the technology remains the same.
在经济衰退中，做生意的程序可能会改变——一些专家（资产）可能会被解雇，但技术保持不变。
In the figure, this situation would correspond to shifting  the  generalist  curve  a  bit.
在[图]()中，这种情况将对应于多面手曲线稍微移动。
Unlike  for  the  specialist,  shifting  the generalist's curve still leaves substantial overlap with the market.
与专家不同的是，改变多面手曲线仍然会与市场产生大量重叠。
The risk of the complex-coupled  businessman  is  thus  not  of  losing  his  job,  as  it  is  for  the specialist,  because  in  principle  the  businessman  doesn't  have  a  job,  and  he'll always be able to work.
因此，复杂耦合的商人的风险不是失去工作，不像专家一样，因为原则上商人没有工作，他总是能够工作。
His risk is in the loss of profit, as profit depends on customers buying his products.
他的风险在于利润损失，因为利润取决于顾客购买他的产品。
In that sense, companies owe their existence to consumers (see Foundations of economics and finance).
从这个意义上说，公司的存在归功于消费者（见[经济和金融的基础]()）。

Unlike the salary man and the working man, the businessman doesn't risk losing his job, though he does risk losing his business.
与工薪族和工人不同，商人不会有失去工作的风险，但他会有失去生意的风险。
Like an exuberant artist or scientist, he is internally driven towards finding solutions and he does not wait for employment to start working--the businessman is an entrepreneur.
像一个精力旺盛的艺术家或科学家一样，他在内心里被驱使着寻找解决方案，他不等待就业机会开始工作——商人是一个企业家。
The risk for the businessman comes from the tight coupling between  shareholders  and bond holders on one side and consumers and workers on the other side, all of whom  must  be  satisfied  with  the  businessman  in  the  middle,  lest  capital  and profits vanish.
商人的风险来自于股东与股东之间的紧密耦合，另一方面来自消费者和工人，他们必须让所有人都感到满意，以免资本和利润消失。
Some companies reduce this risk by having no long-term debt or by having special classes of shares.
一些公司通过无长期债务或持有特殊类别的股票来降低这种风险。
Others reduce it by having many customers or  clients  or  easy  access  to  labor,  either  by  outsourcing,  offering  attractive benefits or simply due to an abundance of workers in a given field.
其他人则通过拥有许多消费者或客户，或通过外包，提供有吸引力的福利，或仅仅由于某一特定领域的大量工人，通过廉价劳动力来降低成本。
However, as long as there is a drive for profit, there will be competition and innovation, and those  risks  are  hard  to  eliminate  without  monopoly  pricing  power,  political favors, and other barriers to entry.
然而，只要有利润驱动，就会有竞争和创新，如果没有垄断定价权、政治支持和其他进入壁垒，这些风险就难以消除。
Since profit is the income of the businessman, and since the businessman needs income to buy stuff for himself, he too is at risk.
因为利润是商人的收入，而且商人需要收入为自己买东西，所以他也有风险。
Many businessmen and entrepreneurs take steps similar to employees and establish emergency funds (see The working man).
许多商人和企业家采取与雇员类似的措施，建立应急基金（见[打工人]()）。
However, those that desire to retire early either need to earn a lot of money fast or find an alternative solution  
然而，那些希望提前退休的人要么快速赚大钱，要么找到另一种解决方案。
