The central heating which everybody in the Western world takes for granted is a strange concept to other cultures. 
在西方世界，每个人都认为理所当然的中央供暖，在其他文化里是一个奇怪的概念。
Central heating has conditioned us to fairly tight  tolerance  ranges. 
中央暖气使我们适应了相当严格的公差范围。
However,  it's  possible  to  change  your  body  to  feeling quite  comfortable  while  sitting  in  a  t-shirt  at  15C  (59F)  or,  alternatively,  deal with 30C (86F) (see A modular design). 
然而，改变你的身体，可以让你在15摄氏度（59华氏度）或30摄氏度（86华氏度）的温度下穿着t恤时，感到非常舒适（参见[模块化设计]()）。

How  warm  or  cold  you  feel  depends  on  metabolism,  circulation,  diet, activity,  clothing,  and  environment.74  If  you've  ever  relocated  from  a  cold climate to  a  warm  climate,  you've  probably been  surprised  at  how  quickly you adapt. 
你感觉的温暖或寒冷程度取决于新陈代谢、循环、饮食、活动、衣服和环境。如果你曾经从寒冷的气候迁移到温暖的气候，你可能会惊讶于自己适应的速度有多快。
What used to be a balmy 10C (50F) outside is now freezing cold. 
曾经温暖的室外温度是10摄氏度（50华氏度），现在却冷得要命。
Feeling warm or cold has a lot to do with adaptation. 
感觉温暖或寒冷与适应有很大关系。
Unfortunately, it's now normal to live in heated and air-conditioned bubbles which allow for no adaptation at all, except perhaps to the price of those services. 
不幸的是，现在生活在暖气和空调的泡泡里，可以不用去适应冷热，但这些服务的价格要适应。
Here's how to do it. 
下面是如何做到这一点。

To adapt to heat, you need to increase the efficacy of your sweat glands. 
为了适应高温，你需要提高汗腺的功能。
This is  best  done  by  exercising  or  being  physically  active  at  high  temperature,  like outside  without air  conditioning. 
最好是在高温下锻炼或运动，比如在没有空调的室外。
With  increased  heat,  you  won't  need  to  eat  to stay warm like you would in a colder environment, and thus you'll eat less. 
随着热量的增加，你不需要像在寒冷环境中那样吃东西来保持温暖，因此你会吃得更少。
Eat lighter foods: more vegetables. 
吃清淡的食物：多吃蔬菜。
This will save money and you'll also be eating in season. 
这样可以省钱，你也可以吃到季节性东西。
Change  your  schedule  to  do  more  physical  work  early  in  the  morning and take a siesta during the warmest hours of the day. 
改变你的时间表，在清晨做更多的体力劳动，在一天中最暖和的时候小睡一会儿。
Sleep outside, or at least with open windows. 
睡在外面，或者至少是开着窗户。
These changes are possible once you achieve control over your work schedule. 
一旦你控制了你的工作日程，这些改变是可能的。

To adapt to cold, try switching to cold showers. 
为了适应寒冷，试着换成冷水淋浴。
Instead of standing under the showerhead,  move  it  around  the  body,  starting  with  the  head  and  extremities. 
不要站在莲蓬头下，而是从头部和四肢开始，在身体周围移动莲蓬头。
This  will  save  on  water  and  heat,  and  it  will  increase  cold  tolerance  and circulation. 
这将节约水和热量，并增加耐寒性和循环。
It  takes  about  two  weeks  to  adapt. 
适应大约需要两周时间。
Any  kind  of  "cheating"  can  be treated as a setback. 
任何形式的“欺骗”都可以被视为后退。
One step forward, two steps back. 
前进一步，后退两步。

Another way to feel warmer (but actually be cooler) is to lose subcutaneous fat  under  the  skin. 
另一种感觉温暖（但实际上是凉爽）的方法是减少皮下脂肪。
This  brings  the  surface  of  the  skin  closer  to  the  heat- generating  sources  (muscles  and  organs)  within  the  body. 
这使得皮肤表面更接近体内的热源（肌肉和器官）。
As  a  consequence, your skin will feel warmer to the touch. 
因此，你的皮肤会通过接触感到温暖。
Since heat loss increases with surface to volume  area  (the  rounder  and  larger  the  body,  the  less  loss--children and  long and  slender  adults  will  lose  more)--this  will  require  more  heat  to  be  generated and consequently you'll need to be more physically active and eat more. 
由于热量损失随着表面积的增加而增加（身体越圆、越大，损失越少——儿童和细长的成年人会损失更多）——这将需要产生更多的热量，因此你需要更多的体力活动和吃更多的东西。

Food  increases  metabolism. 
食物促进新陈代谢。
Warm  food  with  a  high  heat  capacity  (large water content) such as soup comes with thermal energy (heat) as well. 
热容高（含水量大）的温热食物，如汤，也有热能（热量）。
The body will  naturally  want  to  eat  more  when  the  environment  is  cold  because  the metabolism is naturally increased, and vice versa when it's warm. 
当环境寒冷时，身体自然会想要吃得更多，因为新陈代谢会自然增加，当环境温暖时相反。
As a corollary, if  you're  on  reduced  calories,  relative  to  the  ambient  temperature  you'll  feel colder. 
作为推论，如果你摄入的卡路里相对于环境温度减少，你会感觉更冷。
Not  adjusting  one's  eating  to  the  season  (see  Eating  like  a  farmer)  will lead  to  difficulties  when  trying  to  cope  with  warm  weather  without  air conditioning or cold weather without heating. 
在没有空调的温暖天气或没有暖气的寒冷天气中，如果不根据季节调整饮食（参见[吃得像一个农夫]()），将导致困难。

An intensive exercise regime--that is, heavy weightlifting (see High intensity interval  training)  or  similar--substantially  increases  the  metabolism  up  to  24 hours afterwards. 
高强度运动——也就是说，举重（见[高强度间歇训练]()）或类似运动——会显著增加24小时后的新陈代谢。
Low-intensity exercising, like running, cycling, dancing, yoga, etc. 
低强度运动，如跑步、骑自行车、跳舞、瑜伽等。
doesn't  have  a  similar  effect. 
没有类似的效果。
Here,  the  body  reverts  to  normal  within  an hour. 
在这里，身体在一小时内恢复正常。
One solution is to keep moving (also useful when outdoors, in which case if  you're  cold,  move  faster). 
一个解决办法是保持移动（在户外也很有用，如果你很冷，动得更快些）。
some  human muscle power instead of sitting/standing still and pushing buttons. 
需要一定的肌肉力量，而不是坐着/站着不动或按按钮。
example, use manual appliances. 
例如，使用手动设备。
Perform  basic  activities  that  require  For Take up hobbies and crafts with a manual component. 
通过手动工具培养爱好和制作手工艺品。
If you  spend  your  evenings  doing  carpentry  or  baking  (real  baking,  not  powder mixing) it's unlikely that you'll be cold even if the central heating is off. 
如果你晚上做木工或烘焙（真正的烘焙，而不是拌粉），即使中央暖气关闭，你也不太可能感到寒冷。

With  all  this  talk  of  generating  heat,  it  may  be  interesting  to  know  that  a seated person emits around 100W (a sleeping person around 80W). 
关于产生热量的所有这些说法，知道一个坐着的人释放大约100W（一个睡觉的人释放大约80W）可能会很有趣。
This number is  higher  for  someone  who  has  exercised  intensely  within  the  past  24  hours. 
对于在过去24小时内进行过剧烈运动的人来说，这个数字更高。
100W  is  not  much,  but  it's  interesting  to  consider  that  if  you  fill  a  room  with people,  they'll  heat  it  up. 
100W并不多，但有趣的是，如果你把房间挤满了人，他们会把它加热。
High-intensity  workouts  generate  more  than  1000W (see  High  intensity  interval  training),  which  is  comparable  to  a  small  space heater. 
高强度训练产生的功率超过1000W（参见[高强度间歇训练]()），与小空间加热器相当。
For room-heating purposes you can substitute the company of 10 friends with one intensely exercising person. 
为了给房间取暖，你可以用一个剧烈运动的人代替10个朋友的陪伴。

External  heat  sources  offer  a  less  convenient  solution,  since  they  must  be lugged  around. 
外部热源提供了一个不太方便的解决方案，因为它们必须被拖来拖去。
They're  like  the  difference  between  knowing  the  multiplication table by heart and having to use a calculator. 
它们就像是背诵乘法表和使用计算器之间的区别。
The modern solution is the electric blanket. 
现代的解决方案是电热毯。
For half a monthly heating bill, you can buy a heating blanket that will reduce your central heating bills forever. 
花半个月的取暖费，你可以买一条暖毯，这将永远减少你的集中取暖费。
An older, less expensive, and therefore harder to find, solution is the hot water bottle. 
一种更古老、更便宜、因此更难找到的解决方案是热水瓶。
As an alternative, you can use a rice bag. 
作为替代，你可以使用米袋。
Take an old pillow case and sew in a few cups of uncooked rice. 
拿一个旧枕套，缝上几杯生米。
Heat this  in  the  microwave. 
用微波炉加热。
The  heat  capacity  isn't  as  good  as  the  hot  water  bottle. 
热容不如热水瓶好。
These heat sources should be covered by an insulating layer or you'll lose more than half the heat. 
这些热源应该用绝缘层覆盖，否则你会损失一半以上的热量。
With the hot water bottle, you can simply stuff it under your sweater. 
有了热水瓶，你可以简单地把它塞到你的毛衣下面。
Preventing  heat  loss  is  as  important  as  generating  it  in  the  first  place. 
防止热量损失与产生热量一样重要。
This  is  where  adding  layers  of  clothes  outside  the  body  comes  in  handy. 
这就是在身体外增加几层衣服的用武之地。
It's important  to  add  layers  preemptively. 
预先添加层是很重要的。
If  layers  aren't  added,  the  body  will withdraw blood from the limbs to save heat. 
如果不添加层，身体将从四肢抽血以节省热量。
Once this happens and you've got cold feet, the blood will not return and reheat the feet even after you put on extra socks. 
一旦发生这种情况，并且你的脚冷了，即使你穿上额外的袜子，血液也不会回流并重新加热你的脚。
In  this  case,  heat  must  be  generated  in  the  feet  by  stamping,  walking, jumping, or on the feet, by rubbing them. 
在这种情况下，必须通过踩踏、行走、跳跃或在脚上摩擦产生热量。
An alternative is to use biofeedback. 
另一种方法是使用生物反馈。
This  requires  some  practice. 
这需要一些实践。
Concentrate  on  your  feet  and  imagine  they're  in warm water or you're standing on hot coals. 
把注意力集中在你的脚上，想象它们在温水里或者你站在热煤上。
It may take a few minutes to get it to work and it may take several months of practice to learn to control it. 
它可能需要几分钟才能开始工作，并且可能需要几个月的练习才能学会控制它。

Air doesn't conduct heat well and layers trap air. 
空气不能很好地传导热量，层会阻碍空气。
Thus, trapping air prevents heat  transfer  to  or  from  the  environment. 
因此，静止的空气可防止热量向环境传递或从环境传递。
If  you  stick  your  hand  into  a  100C (212F) oven, you won't get burned immediately. 
如果你把手伸进一个100摄氏度（212F）的烤箱里，你不会马上被烫伤。
If you touch 100C water, you'll get burned immediately. 
如果你接触100摄氏度的水，你会立即被烫伤。
Water conducts heat very well. 
水导热很好。
This is also why damp clothes  feel  colder  and  why  staying  dry  is  important  for  staying  warm. 
这也是为什么潮湿的衣服感觉更冷，为什么保持干燥对保持温暖很重要。
Conversely, if you want to cool down, sweat or add water exogenously. 
相反，如果你想冷却下来，出汗或往外边加水。
Causing water to evaporate will cool you even faster. 
让水蒸发会让你更快地降温。
Evaporation can be encouraged by convecting away the air with a high relative humidity around your skin. 
皮肤周围相对湿度高的空气对流可以促进蒸发。
This is the basis of the swamp cooler, (a swamp cooler is a simple system, so you can build your own; it only works where the relative humidity is low) which is useful if  you  can't  sweat  enough  on  your  own. 
这是沼泽冷却器的基础，（沼泽冷却器是一个简单的系统，所以你可以自己建造；它只在相对湿度较低的地方工作），如果你不能自己出汗，它很有用。
If  you  can,  a  fan  will  do. 
如果可以，一个风扇就可以了。
These  days most fans are electric, but you can get a hand fan. 
现在大多数风扇都是电动的，但你可以买一个手动风扇。
You should also wear loose clothing to aid in convection when you move. 
你也应该穿宽松的衣服，当你移动以增加对流。
Conversely, in cool temperatures, wear constricting clothes, like neck ties and cuffs, to seal off air movements. 
相反，在凉爽的温度下，穿紧身衣，如领带和袖口，以防止空气流动。

Given  standard-sized  rooms,  focus  on  heating  and  cooling  the  body  rather than  the  room. 
对于标准尺寸的房间，重点是加热和冷却身体，而不是房间。
Heating  unused  rooms  isn't  harmonious  with  financial independence as money is being wasted; nor are large rooms. 
取暖未使用的房间与财务独立不协调，因为钱被浪费了；大房间也一样。

If you have the choice, go with smaller rooms. 
如果你有选择的话，可以选择较小的房间。
Small (100sqft/person), well- insulated rooms can be heated and cooled at almost no cost; consider this along with future projections of the cost of heating oil. 
小型（10平方米/人），隔热良好的房间几乎可以免费加热和冷却；考虑这一点，以及未来对加热油成本的预测。
It may be useful to know that should  the  central  heating  be  switched  off  for  whatever  reason,  you  can approximate a small room by pitching a tent in your living room and sleeping in that. 
如果中央暖气因任何原因被关闭，你可以在你的起居室搭一个帐篷，然后在里面睡觉，这可能是有用的。

Without  the  benefit  of  small  rooms,  heating  and  cooling  means  changing habits to be more in tune with the seasons--that is, letting the room temperature follow  the  outside  temperature  more  closely. 
如果没有小房间的好处，取暖和制冷意味着改变习惯，使之更符合季节——也就是说，让房间温度更接近室外温度。
The  barrier  here  is  that  modern people  live  in  bubbles,  only  spending  trivial  amounts  of  time  outside  their offices, houses, cars, and shopping centers. 
这里的障碍是现代人生活在泡泡中，在办公室、房子、汽车和购物中心之外花费的时间很少。
Modern sedentary habits have almost eliminated  physiological  advantages  and  adaptation. 
现代久坐的习惯几乎消除了生理优势和适应性。
How  to  dress  and  behave for  seasons  and  weather  have  been  forgotten,  and  so  people  own  improper clothing  which  is  uncomfortable  outside  the  range  of  "modern  room temperature."  By  wearing  the  right  clothes  (see  Clothes)  and  changing  a  few habits, it takes about two weeks to adapt physiologically.
人们已经忘记了如何在季节和天气中穿着和行动，这些不合适的衣服，让人除了在“现代室温”之外，都感到不舒服。
通过穿着合适的衣服（见[衣服]()）和改变一些习惯，这大约需要两周的时间让生理来适应。
