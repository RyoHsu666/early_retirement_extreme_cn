When  credit  and  consumer  financing  is  widely  available,  the  personal savings rate is close to zero.

Few really want to save when they can count on credit cards for large purchases or to carry them over in case of a job loss.

As such,  interest  works  in  reverse.

Rather  than  saving  up  money  and  receiving interest along the way before spending it on a purchase, credit is used to make the purchase immediately.

Over time, the debt is paid off, along with interest, until  the  payments  are  sufficiently  low  that  one  can  go  into  debt  again.

This inverted sawtooth pattern happens on several different time-scales, the longest being the mortgage, with shorter time-scales for car loans, home equity loans, and lines of credit, with credit card loans being the shortest.

Often, the latter are rolled over and thus constitute a permanent drain on one's earnings.

Naturally, this is an inefficient and costly way to handle one's personal finances.


It's risky too.

First, if new loans are the only way to raise cash, because all existing income  goes towards  bills  and cost  of living,  and  new loans  are  not available because credit has been maxed out, then a sudden need for cash--for example, to fix a leaky roof, or any other emergency--is a serious problem.

It can typically be solved, but only at very high interest rates.

Sometimes interest rates are  capped  by  usury  laws,  thus  preventing  a  legal  market  solution.

Second, paying off the loans typically requires steady monthly payments.

If the debtor misses a payment, perhaps due to a temporary job loss or the aforementioned emergency, interest rates may be raised substantially, or the lender may repossess collateral.

To  prevent  this,  people  either  spend  money  taking  out  insurance against  such  a  situation,  either  with  the  bank  and  credit  card  companies themselves  or  with  third-party  insurance  agents.

Self-insuring  by  keeping  a number of months of expenses in a savings account, which people with jobs,  debt, bills, and other financial obligations call an emergency fund, is becoming an increasingly popular alternative.


Other  common  reasons  to  save  include  down  payments  on  a  house,  car, vacation,  education,  or  health.

These  expenditures  can't  be  financed  because they're  unsecured  or  because  the  lender  requires  the  down  payment  as  a demonstration  of  financial  responsibility.

Naturally,  other  lenders  are  often willing  to  step  in  to  finance  the  down  payment  at  higher  interest  rates,  thus eliminating  the  risk  control  of  the  primary  lender's  requirement  for  a  down payment.

Retirement  for  those  who  are  too  old  to  work  and  take  care  of themselves can't be financed by credit because of the difficulty in paying back the loan.

Traditionally, those who are too old to take care of themselves have relied on having children and instilling a feeling of filial duty.

However, those filial feelings are perhaps no longer as strong as they once were, with parents having sent their children off to institutions from a young age and only really interacted with them for a few hours a day, being busy with their careers and lawns.

Children thus often prefer to send their parents to institutions of their own during old age, in turn.


Therefore it falls on institutions, in the form of the government and private companies, to provide for people during old age.

The plans offered by private companies are either defined contribution plans, where the individual takes all the risk, or defined benefit plans, where the institution takes all the risk.

In the latter case, the government is betting on the willingness of future taxpayers to pay  a  sufficient  amount  of  taxes,  and  the  companies  are  betting  on  the willingness of future customers to buy their products.


These plans are generally meshed with tax legislation, yielding tax benefits at the cost of losing access to the money until the officially sanctioned retirement age.

This  means  that  any  such  plan  presumes  that  everybody  will  work  until they're 60 to 70 years old, and that the tax-advantaged limits are set so that a majority  of  people  will  be  able  to  save  just  about  10-20%  of  their  earnings without losing the tax advantage.

In turn, this means that workers need 30+ years on  the  job  to  gather  enough  to  replace  their  working  income  with  savings withdrawals (see Financial independence and investing).

This also means that your typical financial planner will presume that everybody desires to work until they're 60 or 70 years old.

Most importantly, it means everybody assumes that working until 60 or 70 is the only way to achieve retirement.

With this frame of mind, it's not surprising that retiring at 50 is still considered early, despite the modern possibility of retiring decades earlier.


Thanks  to  a  secular--possibly  demographically  driven--asset  boom,  it  has become increasingly popular for individuals to save for retirement by investing  directly in the equity/financial markets, a job that has previously been handled by  banks  and  businessmen,  using  the  savings  of  the  customers.

This  kind  of "investing" is thought of as a savings account compounding at very high interest rates that are believed to manifest themselves as practically risk-free by waving one's arms and mumbling something about "the long run.

" However, dollar cost averaging--in the form of regular and typically automatic monthly contributions to a retirement account based on financial investments--is conceptually not much different from establishing a savings account in a foreign currency, except this one is denominated in company equity.

Both suffer from the risk of needing to sell in a down market.


Dollar  cost  averaging  naturally  provides  steady  employment  for  fund managers  and  most  everyone  else  associated  with  the  stock  market.

Regular contributions are therefore sold to the public as something that is beneficial.

In reality,  dollar  cost  averaging  is  a  double-edged  sword.

Proponents  usually imagine a scenario of an initial market decline that recovers.

In this case, even though the starting and ending price are the same, the average cost is lower, thus resulting in an overall investment gain.

Now consider the scenario of a rising market that subsequently declines.

In this case, the average cost is higher than the start and ending price, and the investor will have lost money.

In fact, given that  markets  rise  much  more  slowly  than  they  drop,  a  dollar  cost  averaging investor is more likely to make an entry and invest larger amounts while the market  is  rising  than  during  its  decline.

At  its  best,  dollar  cost  averaging provides no benefit, but regardless, dollar cost averaging is an excellent way of providing steady work for Wall Street, which collects fees and commissions to invest the steady stream of money from workers.


The mutual fund industry typically charges around one percent of all assets annually, which over the years adds up to a substantial fraction, regardless of performance.

Since the risk-reward profiles of most, but not all fund advisors are skewed--that is, fail conventionally and you're okay; fail unconventionally and you're  fired;  win  conventionally  and  you're  okay;  win  unconventionally  and you're a genius--mutual fund advisors that wish to keep their jobs tend to flock together and behave like a herd.

This has resulted in the growing popularity of "buy and hold" index funds, which simply mimic what everybody else is doing, on average, at less cost.

Of course, the emerging behavior of such a strategy is eventual chaos, as nobody leads and everybody follows each other.


Buy  and  hold  is  an  investment  strategy  with  no  exit  strategy.

What  this typically  means  is  that  stocks  are  usually  liquidated  when  money  is  needed, rather than taking into account when a given stock is overvalued.

The aggregate effect of workers investing in this manner is to turn the stock market into an  elaborate demographical Ponzi scheme, where the value of investments depends on how many people are retiring and how many people are entering the labor market.

In particular, it depends on the level of confidence that the most recent entrant  has  in  the  system,  and  hence  this  becomes  a  policy  matter.

Diversification  doesn't  prevent  the  effects  of  something  as  systemic  as  this.

Instead, it reinforces the problem, as everybody behaves the same.

If stocks are supplied  and  demanded  according  to  how  many  are  entering  and  leaving  the workforce, then market price becomes dependent on demographics.


The  consequence  of  retirement  accounts  and  the  reliance  on  automatic savings in equity markets is a large class of people who have very little equity ownership  compared  to  their  level  of  consumption.

Nobody  thinks  of  using improvements in technology and productivity to allow people to work less and require  fewer  assets  to  achieve  the  same  standard  of  living.

Instead,  while everybody  is  richer,  at  least  in  terms  of  stuff,  no  one  is  any  wealthier.

Their wealth is "safely" out of reach.

If it weren't, how many would still show up for work the next day? 


Individual  investment  in  productivity  other  than  personal  ability  to  work harder  remains  dismally  low.

Only  a  few  entrepreneurs  spend  money  on increasing their productivity to increase their current cash flow.

Others have few asset investments outside of their retirement accounts.
