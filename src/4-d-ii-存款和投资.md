When  credit  and  consumer  financing  is  widely  available,  the  personal savings rate is close to zero.
当信贷和消费融资广泛可用时，个人储蓄率接近于零。
Few really want to save when they can count on credit cards for large purchases or to carry them over in case of a job loss.
当他们可以依靠信用卡进行大额购物或在失业时继续使用信用卡时，很少有人真的想存钱。
As such,  interest  works  in  reverse.
因此，利息的作用是相反的。
Rather  than  saving  up  money  and  receiving interest along the way before spending it on a purchase, credit is used to make the purchase immediately.
信贷被用于立即购买，而不是在购买前存钱并获得利息。
Over time, the debt is paid off, along with interest, until  the  payments  are  sufficiently  low  that  one  can  go  into  debt  again.
随着时间的推移，债务连同利息一起还清，直到付款额足够低后，人们可以再次负债。
This inverted sawtooth pattern happens on several different time-scales, the longest being the mortgage, with shorter time-scales for car loans, home equity loans, and lines of credit, with credit card loans being the shortest.
这种倒锯齿模式发生在几个不同的时间尺度上，最长的是房屋贷款，较短的是汽车贷款、房屋净值贷款和信用额度的，信用卡贷款是最短的。
Often, the latter are rolled over and thus constitute a permanent drain on one's earnings.
通常情况下，后者会被展期，从而对一个人的收入构成永久性的消耗。
Naturally, this is an inefficient and costly way to handle one's personal finances.
当然，这是一种效率低下、成本高昂的个人理财方式。

It's risky too.
这也很危险。
First, if new loans are the only way to raise cash, because all existing income  goes towards  bills  and cost  of living,  and  new loans  are  not available because credit has been maxed out, then a sudden need for cash--for example, to fix a leaky roof, or any other emergency--is a serious problem.
首先，如果新贷款是筹集现金的唯一途径，因为所有现有收入都用于支付账单和生活费用，而新贷款无法获得，因为信贷已被耗尽，那么突然需要现金——例如，修理漏水的屋顶或任何其他紧急情况——都是一个严重的问题。
It can typically be solved, but only at very high interest rates.
它通常是可以解决的，非常高的利率。
Sometimes interest rates are  capped  by  usury  laws,  thus  preventing  a  legal  market  solution.
有时，利率受到高利贷法律的限制，从而妨碍了合法的市场解决方案。
Second, paying off the loans typically requires steady monthly payments.
其次，还清贷款通常需要每月稳定的还款。
If the debtor misses a payment, perhaps due to a temporary job loss or the aforementioned emergency, interest rates may be raised substantially, or the lender may repossess collateral.
如果债务人错过付款，可能是由于暂时失业或上述紧急情况，利率可能会大幅提高，或者贷款人可能收回抵押品。
To  prevent  this,  people  either  spend  money  taking  out  insurance against  such  a  situation,  either  with  the  bank  and  credit  card  companies themselves  or  with  third-party  insurance  agents.
为了防止这种情况发生，人们要么与银行和信用卡公司，要么与第三方保险代理人，花钱购买针对这种情况的保险。
Self-insuring  by  keeping  a number of months of expenses in a savings account, which people with jobs,  debt, bills, and other financial obligations call an emergency fund, is becoming an increasingly popular alternative.
通过将几个月的费用存入储蓄账户（有工作、债务、账单和其他财务义务的人称之为应急基金）来进行自我保险，正成为越来越受欢迎的选择。

Other  common  reasons  to  save  include  down  payments  on  a  house,  car, vacation,  education,  or  health.
其他常见的储蓄原因包括房屋、汽车、度假、教育或健康等的首付。
These  expenditures  can't  be  financed  because they're  unsecured  or  because  the  lender  requires  the  down  payment  as  a demonstration  of  financial  responsibility.
这些支出无法融资，因为它们是无担保的，或者因为贷款人要求首付作为财务责任的证明。
Naturally,  other  lenders  are  often willing  to  step  in  to  finance  the  down  payment  at  higher  interest  rates,  thus eliminating  the  risk  control  of  the  primary  lender's  requirement  for  a  down payment.
自然，其他贷款人往往愿意以更高的利率介入为首付款融资，从而消除了主要贷款人要求首付款的风险控制。
Retirement  for  those  who  are  too  old  to  work  and  take  care  of themselves can't be financed by credit because of the difficulty in paying back the loan.
对于那些年纪太大而不能工作和照顾自己的人来说，由于偿还贷款的困难，他们的退休不能通过信贷获得资金。
Traditionally, those who are too old to take care of themselves have relied on having children and instilling a feeling of filial duty.
传统上，那些太老而不能照顾自己的人依靠生孩子和灌输一种孝顺的责任。
However, those filial feelings are perhaps no longer as strong as they once were, with parents having sent their children off to institutions from a young age and only really interacted with them for a few hours a day, being busy with their careers and lawns.
然而，这些孝顺的情感可能不再像以前那样强烈了，父母从小就把孩子送到机构里，每天只与他们互动几个小时，转头去忙他们的事业和草坪。
Children thus often prefer to send their parents to institutions of their own during old age, in turn.
反过来，孩子们往往更愿意将年老的父母送到他们自己的机构。

Therefore it falls on institutions, in the form of the government and private companies, to provide for people during old age.
因此，以政府和私营公司的形式为老年人提供服务的机构就承担了责任。
The plans offered by private companies are either defined contribution plans, where the individual takes all the risk, or defined benefit plans, where the institution takes all the risk.
私营公司提供的计划要么是个人承担所有风险的固定缴款计划，要么是机构承担所有风险的固定收益计划。
In the latter case, the government is betting on the willingness of future taxpayers to pay  a  sufficient  amount  of  taxes,  and  the  companies  are  betting  on  the willingness of future customers to buy their products.
在后一种情况下，政府押注于未来纳税人是否愿意支付足够的税款，而企业押注于未来客户是否愿意购买其产品。

These plans are generally meshed with tax legislation, yielding tax benefits at the cost of losing access to the money until the officially sanctioned retirement age.
这些计划通常与税收立法相结合，以在正式批准的退休年龄之前无法获得资金为代价，产生税收优惠。
This  means  that  any  such  plan  presumes  that  everybody  will  work  until they're 60 to 70 years old, and that the tax-advantaged limits are set so that a majority  of  people  will  be  able  to  save  just  about  10-20%  of  their  earnings without losing the tax advantage.
这意味着，这样的计划都假定每个人都将工作到60岁到70岁，并且税收优惠限制的设定使得，大多数人能够在不失去税收优惠的情况下，储蓄大约10-20%的收入。
In turn, this means that workers need 30+ years on  the  job  to  gather  enough  to  replace  their  working  income  with  savings withdrawals (see Financial independence and investing).
反过来，这意味着工人需要30年以上的工作时间来收集足够的钱，用储蓄取款来代替他们的工作收入（参见[财务独立和投资]()）。
This also means that your typical financial planner will presume that everybody desires to work until they're 60 or 70 years old.
这也意味着，你的典型的理财规划师会假设每个人都希望工作到60岁或70岁。
Most importantly, it means everybody assumes that working until 60 or 70 is the only way to achieve retirement.
最重要的是，这意味着每个人都认为工作到60或70岁是实现退休的唯一途径。
With this frame of mind, it's not surprising that retiring at 50 is still considered early, despite the modern possibility of retiring decades earlier.
有了这种心态，50岁退休仍然被认为很早，这并不奇怪，尽管现在提前几十年退休是有可能的。

Thanks  to  a  secular--possibly  demographically  driven--asset  boom,  it  has become increasingly popular for individuals to save for retirement by investing  directly in the equity/financial markets, a job that has previously been handled by  banks  and  businessmen,  using  the  savings  of  the  customers.
由于长期的——可能是人口驱动的——资产繁荣，个人通过直接投资股票/金融市场为退休进行储蓄变得越来越流行，这项工作以前由银行和商人利用客户的储蓄来进行。
This  kind  of "investing" is thought of as a savings account compounding at very high interest rates that are believed to manifest themselves as practically risk-free by waving one's arms and mumbling something about "the long run.
这种“投资”被认为是一种复利极高的储蓄账户，人们相信，通过挥舞手臂和喃喃自语“长期来看”自己实际上是无风险的。
" However, dollar cost averaging--in the form of regular and typically automatic monthly contributions to a retirement account based on financial investments--is conceptually not much different from establishing a savings account in a foreign currency, except this one is denominated in company equity.
然而，平均成本法——通常是基于金融投资的定期和自动每月向退休账户供款的形式——在概念上与以外币建立储蓄账户没有太大区别，但这一账户以公司股本计价。
Both suffer from the risk of needing to sell in a down market.
两者都面临着需要在低迷市场中出售的风险。

Dollar  cost  averaging  naturally  provides  steady  employment  for  fund managers  and  most  everyone  else  associated  with  the  stock  market.
平均成本法自然为基金经理和大多数与股市相关的人提供了稳定的就业机会。
Regular contributions are therefore sold to the public as something that is beneficial.
因此，定期投入被作为有益的东西出售给公众。
In reality,  dollar  cost  averaging  is  a  double-edged  sword.
事实上，平均成本法是一把双刃剑。
Proponents  usually imagine a scenario of an initial market decline that recovers.
支持者通常会设想一种情况，即最初的市场衰退会恢复。
In this case, even though the starting and ending price are the same, the average cost is lower, thus resulting in an overall investment gain.
在这种情况下，即使起始和终止价格相同，平均成本也较低，从而导致总体投资收益。
Now consider the scenario of a rising market that subsequently declines.
现在考虑一个不断上涨的市场，随后下跌。
In this case, the average cost is higher than the start and ending price, and the investor will have lost money.
在这种情况下，平均成本高于起止价格，投资者将蒙受损失。
In fact, given that  markets  rise  much  more  slowly  than  they  drop,  a  dollar  cost  averaging investor is more likely to make an entry and invest larger amounts while the market  is  rising  than  during  its  decline.
事实上，考虑到市场的上涨速度比下跌速度慢得多，一个平均成本的投资者，更有可能在市场上涨时进入市场并投入更多的资金。
At  its  best,  dollar  cost  averaging provides no benefit, but regardless, dollar cost averaging is an excellent way of providing steady work for Wall Street, which collects fees and commissions to invest the steady stream of money from workers.
在最好的情况下，平均成本法没有任何好处，但无论如何，平均成本法是为华尔街提供稳定工作的一种极好的方法，华尔街通过收取费用和佣金来投资工人，来源源不断地获取资金。

The mutual fund industry typically charges around one percent of all assets annually, which over the years adds up to a substantial fraction, regardless of performance.
共同基金行业通常每年收取所有资产约1%的费用，无论业绩如何，经年累月，这一费用加起来是相当可观。
Since the risk-reward profiles of most, but not all fund advisors are skewed--that is, fail conventionally and you're okay; fail unconventionally and you're  fired;  win  conventionally  and  you're  okay;  win  unconventionally  and you're a genius--mutual fund advisors that wish to keep their jobs tend to flock together and behave like a herd.
因为大多数（但不是所有）基金顾问的风险回报曲线都是扭曲的——也就是说，按惯例失败，你没什么事；非常规地失败，你就会被解雇；按惯例获胜，你没什么事；非常规地获胜，你就是一个天才——希望保住工作的共同基金顾问往往成群结队，表现得像羊群。
This has resulted in the growing popularity of "buy and hold" index funds, which simply mimic what everybody else is doing, on average, at less cost.
这导致“买入并持有”指数基金越来越受欢迎，它只是简单地模仿其他人的做法，平均而言，成本更低。
Of course, the emerging behavior of such a strategy is eventual chaos, as nobody leads and everybody follows each other.
当然，这样一种战略的出现行为最终会造成混乱，因为没有人领导，每个人都在相互追随。

Buy  and  hold  is  an  investment  strategy  with  no  exit  strategy.
买入并持有是一种没有退出策略的投资策略。
What  this typically  means  is  that  stocks  are  usually  liquidated  when  money  is  needed, rather than taking into account when a given stock is overvalued.
这通常意味着，当需要资金时，股票通常会被清算，而不是考虑给定股票被高估的情况。
The aggregate effect of workers investing in this manner is to turn the stock market into an  elaborate demographical Ponzi scheme, where the value of investments depends on how many people are retiring and how many people are entering the labor market.
工人以这种方式投资的总体效果是，股市变成一个复杂的人口庞氏骗局，投资的价值取决于有多少人退休，有多少人进入劳动力市场。
In particular, it depends on the level of confidence that the most recent entrant  has  in  the  system,  and  hence  this  becomes  a  policy  matter.
特别是，这取决于最新加入者对系统的信心程度，因此这成为一个政策问题。
Diversification  doesn't  prevent  the  effects  of  something  as  systemic  as  this.
多样化并不能阻止像这样系统性的事情的影响。
Instead, it reinforces the problem, as everybody behaves the same.
相反，它强化了问题，因为每个人的行为都是一样的。
If stocks are supplied  and  demanded  according  to  how  many  are  entering  and  leaving  the workforce, then market price becomes dependent on demographics.
如果股票的供给和需求是根据进入和离开劳动力的人数来决定的，那么市场价格就取决于人口统计。

The  consequence  of  retirement  accounts  and  the  reliance  on  automatic savings in equity markets is a large class of people who have very little equity ownership  compared  to  their  level  of  consumption.
退休账户和对股票市场自动储蓄的依赖的后果是，与他们的消费水平相比，一大群人几乎没有股票的所有权。
Nobody  thinks  of  using improvements in technology and productivity to allow people to work less and require  fewer  assets  to  achieve  the  same  standard  of  living.
没有人想到利用技术和生产力的进步来让人们减少工作，减少资产需求，从而达到同样的生活水平。
Instead,  while everybody  is  richer,  at  least  in  terms  of  stuff,  no  one  is  any  wealthier.
相反，虽然每个人都更富有，至少在物质方面，但没有人真正的富有一些。
Their wealth is "safely" out of reach.
他们的财富“安全地”遥不可及。
If it weren't, how many would still show up for work the next day? 
如果不是，第二天还会有多少人上班？

Individual  investment  in  productivity  other  than  personal  ability  to  work harder  remains  dismally  low.
除了个人努力工作的能力之外，个人对生产力的投资仍然少得可怜。
Only  a  few  entrepreneurs  spend  money  on increasing their productivity to increase their current cash flow.
只有少数企业家花钱提高生产率以增加当前现金流。
Others have few asset investments outside of their retirement accounts.
其他人在退休账户之外几乎没有资产投资。
