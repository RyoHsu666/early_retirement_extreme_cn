The  best  way  to  understand  the  Renaissance  man  is  through  the  use  of  an analogy--a  university.

Most  universities  research  and  teach  a  wide  variety  of subjects  that  are  further  split  into  courses  taught  by  corresponding  experts.

In other  words,  the  subjects  are  diversified.

This  means  that  if  any  one  or  even several subjects suddenly became obsolete, the university as a whole would still function.

The  experts  are  gathered  into  departments  and  institutes.

Typically, experts  within  their  respective  departments  are  strongly  connected  (Physics- Physics).

Usually,  they  will  also  connect  somewhat  more  loosely  in interdisciplinary  studies  with  other  departments  in  the  institute  (Physics- Astronomy), and sometimes they may go outside the institute and connect with experts at other institutes (Physics-History).

For a university, each institute  and each department functions almost independently of the other.

In other words, a university is modularized, and through the collaborations that connect different kinds of expertise, new knowledge and complex solutions are created.

Therefore, a  university  is  consilient.

Despite  its  complexity,  a  university  isn't  subject  to catastrophic failure whenever a professor has to cancel a lecture due to illness or a meeting, or whenever students don't come back in time after spring break, or when equipment doesn't show up on schedule or a laboratory gets flooded by a rainstorm.

People (professors, students, and administrators) simply rearrange and reschedule  without  issue,  because  the  entire  system  is  built  on  a  foundation  of loosely  coupled  feedbacks.

Hence,  jarring  one  part  of  the  system  does  not noticeably affect the other parts.


Compare this to the businessman, who in many respects is similar except that loose  feedbacks,  which  in  the  business  world  are  known  as  inefficiencies (because time is money), are now tightly coupled feedbacks.

40 A business is like a  nuclear  power  plant,  which  is  a  complex  and  tightly  coupled  system.

Here many  failsafes  (over  a  dozen  for  some  parts)  are  in  place  to  keep  the  system operating  within  its  tolerance  limits.

If  one  failsafe  breaks,  another  picks  up.

Another  example  is  the  financial  system.

Rather  than  focusing  on  stable operation  like  in  nuclear  power  plants,  financial  engineering  was  used  to leverage to maximize profit using relatively tiny differences between the strong opposing  forces  of  assets  and  liabilities--that  is,  in  the  most  general  sense,  by borrowing large amounts of money at a low interest rate and lending/sending it back out at a slightly higher rate.

This tight coupling led to cascading failures, where  failing  parts  caused  other  parts  to  fail,  and  so  on,  until  a  buffer  was created  by  the  taxpayers  with  the  government  as  a  proxy.

Any  part  that  is  so tightly coupled that it can't be saved in the time it takes to decouple, will fail.


The salary man is the simplest to understand, but not necessarily the simplest to live as.

Real world examples of something that is simple but tightly coupled includes  most  technology,  as  "simple  and  tightly  coupled"  is  almost  the definition  of  technology  or  a  tool.

Examples  of  industry  thus  comprise Industrialism 1.

0, with its heavy, centralized engines--that is, dams, water supply and waste water treatment, many conveyer belt systems, power looms, printing presses, and so on, down to most consumer technology.

In short, these can all be stopped  by  throwing  a  switch,  but  their  stoppage  will  not  begin  to  affect  other systems.

The  reader  may  note  that  those  tool  or  cog-like  qualities  are  actually ideal for a work force, though not for the individuals themselves, many of whom have  little  control  over  their  work  and  are  just  one  paycheck away  from  being unable to pay rent or put food on the table.

This is generally not a very desirable position  to  be  in,  so  the  aim  for  anyone  in  this  category  is  to  bring  in  more income by entrepreneuring complex systems as a businessman or by introducing slack, like emergency funds.

Despite its inherent problems of lacking resilience and  consilience,  salaried  work  is  amazingly  popular  among  employees.

It  is heavily  promoted  by  employers,  who  keep  calling  for  better  tools  (career professionals)  to  operate  their  ongoing  concerns.

Most  books  on  personal finance or productivity focus on this area.


The working man can accommodate shocks and short-term failures (like job loss  or  car  breakdown)  without  destabilizing.

Any  industry  that  operates  on  a franchising  or  similar  model  (the  Post  Office)  and  any  industry  that  has  seen outsourcing  is  an  example  of  this.

If  a  supplier  fails,  other  suppliers  are  found within  the  time  it  takes  to  run  out  of  inventory.

Similarly,  a  new  job  is  found before the emergency fund is depleted.

However, since the strategy is preset by society  (see  The  lock-in),  improvements  are  limited  to  tactics  such  as introducing  more  slack  through  reserve  funds,  using  the  proper  amount  of savings  and  insurance,  and  simply  running  the  operation  faster--hence  the fascination with lifehacking, productivity, time-saving strategies, and the almost fanatical  discussions  of  exactly  how  large  the  emergency  fund  should  be  and how much one should spend on each budget category.


Now, knowing the difference between the categories is one thing, but if you have  ever  been  involved  in  a  start-up  or  gone  through  any  other  kind  of transformation,  you'll  know  that  the  underlying  thinking  and  feeling  of  the finished  stage  can  be  very  different  from  the  thinking  and  feeling  in  the intermediate  stage,  which  again  is  different  from  the  initial  stage,  exactly because it's a complex, nonlinear process.

Therefore, we'll now look at principles for creating the initial stage of consilience and resilience in a life strategy.
