The  best  way  to  understand  the  Renaissance  man  is  through  the  use  of  an analogy--a  university.
理解文艺复兴人的最好方法是通过一个类比——一所大学。
Most  universities  research  and  teach  a  wide  variety  of subjects  that  are  further  split  into  courses  taught  by  corresponding  experts.
大多数大学都研究和教授各种各样的科目，这些科目又进一步分为相应的专家教授的课程。
In other  words,  the  subjects  are  diversified.
换句话说，主题是多样化的。
This  means  that  if  any  one  or  even several subjects suddenly became obsolete, the university as a whole would still function.
这意味着，如果任何一门或几门学科突然过时，大学作为一个整体仍将发挥作用。
The  experts  are  gathered  into  departments  and  institutes.
专家们聚集在各个部门和研究所。
Typically, experts  within  their  respective  departments  are  strongly  connected  (Physics- Physics).
典型地，他们各自部门内的专家有着紧密的联系（物理学-物理学）。
Usually,  they  will  also  connect  somewhat  more  loosely  in interdisciplinary  studies  with  other  departments  in  the  institute  (Physics- Astronomy), and sometimes they may go outside the institute and connect with experts at other institutes (Physics-History).
通常，他们在跨学科研究中也会与研究所的其他部门（物理学-天文学）联系得比较松散，有时他们可能会走出研究所，与其他研究所的专家联系（物理学史）。
For a university, each institute  and each department functions almost independently of the other.
对于一所大学来说，每个学院和每个系的运作几乎是相互独立的。
In other words, a university is modularized, and through the collaborations that connect different kinds of expertise, new knowledge and complex solutions are created.
换言之，大学是模块化的，通过将不同类型的专业知识、新知识和复杂解决方案联系起来的协作，创建了新知识和复杂解决方案。
Therefore, a  university  is  consilient.
因此，大学是协同的。
Despite  its  complexity,  a  university  isn't  subject  to catastrophic failure whenever a professor has to cancel a lecture due to illness or a meeting, or whenever students don't come back in time after spring break, or when equipment doesn't show up on schedule or a laboratory gets flooded by a rainstorm.
尽管大学很复杂，但当教授因病或开会而不得不取消讲座时，或当学生春假后不能及时回来时，或当设备不能按时出现时，或当实验室被暴雨淹没时，大学都不会发生灾难性的失败。
People (professors, students, and administrators) simply rearrange and reschedule  without  issue,  because  the  entire  system  is  built  on  a  foundation  of loosely  coupled  feedbacks.
人们（教授、学生和管理员）简单地重新安排和重排时间表都没有问题，因为整个系统是建立在松散耦合反馈的基础上的。
Hence,  jarring  one  part  of  the  system  does  not noticeably affect the other parts.
因此，震动系统的一部分不会明显影响其他部分。

Compare this to the businessman, who in many respects is similar except that loose  feedbacks,  which  in  the  business  world  are  known  as  inefficiencies (because time is money), are now tightly coupled feedbacks.
与此相比，这和商人在许多方面都很相似，除了松散的反馈，这在商界被称为低效（因为时间就是金钱），现在都是紧密耦合的反馈。
40 A business is like a  nuclear  power  plant,  which  is  a  complex  and  tightly  coupled  system.
企业就像核电站，是一个复杂且紧密耦合的系统。
Here many  failsafes  (over  a  dozen  for  some  parts)  are  in  place  to  keep  the  system operating  within  its  tolerance  limits.
在这里，有许多故障保护（某些部件有十几个），以保持系统在其公差范围内运行。
If  one  failsafe  breaks,  another  picks  up.
如果一个故障保护装置断开，另一个会接上。
Another  example  is  the  financial  system.
另一个例子是金融系统。
Rather  than  focusing  on  stable operation  like  in  nuclear  power  plants,  financial  engineering  was  used  to leverage to maximize profit using relatively tiny differences between the strong opposing  forces  of  assets  and  liabilities--that  is,  in  the  most  general  sense,  by borrowing large amounts of money at a low interest rate and lending/sending it back out at a slightly higher rate.
金融工程不是像核电站那样专注于稳定运行，而是利用资产和负债这两种强大的对立力量之间相对较小的差异，利用杠杆来实现利润最大化——也就是说，在最普遍的意义上，以低利率借入大量资金，然后以略高的利率借出/汇回。
This tight coupling led to cascading failures, where  failing  parts  caused  other  parts  to  fail,  and  so  on,  until  a  buffer  was created  by  the  taxpayers  with  the  government  as  a  proxy.
这种紧密耦合导致了级联故障，故障部件导致其他部件故障，以此类推，直到纳税人以政府为代理创建了缓冲区。
Any  part  that  is  so tightly coupled that it can't be saved in the time it takes to decouple, will fail.
任何紧密耦合的部件，如果无法在解耦所需的时间内保存，都将失败。

The salary man is the simplest to understand, but not necessarily the simplest to live as.
领薪水的人是最容易理解的，但不一定是最容易生活的。
Real world examples of something that is simple but tightly coupled includes  most  technology,  as  "simple  and  tightly  coupled"  is  almost  the definition  of  technology  or  a  tool.
现实世界中简单但紧密耦合的事物包括大多数技术，因为“简单且紧密耦合”几乎是技术或工具的定义。
Examples  of  industry  thus  comprise Industrialism 1.
因此，工业的例子包括工业主义。
0, with its heavy, centralized engines--that is, dams, water supply and waste water treatment, many conveyer belt systems, power looms, printing presses, and so on, down to most consumer technology.
它的重型、集中式发动机——即水坝、供水和废水处理、许多输送带系统、动力织机、印刷机等，一直到大多数消费技术。
In short, these can all be stopped  by  throwing  a  switch,  but  their  stoppage  will  not  begin  to  affect  other systems.
简言之，这些都可以通过扳一个开关来停止，但它们的停止不会开始影响其他系统。
The  reader  may  note  that  those  tool  or  cog-like  qualities  are  actually ideal for a work force, though not for the individuals themselves, many of whom have  little  control  over  their  work  and  are  just  one  paycheck away  from  being unable to pay rent or put food on the table.
读者可能会注意到，这些工具或齿轮状物质实际上对劳动力来说是理想的，但对个人来说并非如此，他们中的许多人几乎无法控制自己的工作，离付不起房租或吃不上饭间只有一张工资单。
This is generally not a very desirable position  to  be  in,  so  the  aim  for  anyone  in  this  category  is  to  bring  in  more income by entrepreneuring complex systems as a businessman or by introducing slack, like emergency funds.
这通常不是一个非常理想的职位，因此这一类人的目标是通过以商人的身份创业复杂系统，或引入应急基金等闲置资金来带来更多收入。
Despite its inherent problems of lacking resilience and  consilience,  salaried  work  is  amazingly  popular  among  employees.
尽管其固有的问题是缺乏弹性和一致性，但领薪工作在员工中仍然非常受欢迎。
It  is heavily  promoted  by  employers,  who  keep  calling  for  better  tools  (career professionals)  to  operate  their  ongoing  concerns.
雇主大力提倡这一点，他们不断呼吁使用更好的工具（职业专业人员）来运营他们不断发展的关注点。
Most  books  on  personal finance or productivity focus on this area.
大多数关于个人理财或生产力的书籍都关注这一领域。

The working man can accommodate shocks and short-term failures (like job loss  or  car  breakdown)  without  destabilizing.
工人可以在不破坏稳定的情况下适应冲击和短期故障（如失业或汽车故障）。
Any  industry  that  operates  on  a franchising  or  similar  model  (the  Post  Office)  and  any  industry  that  has  seen outsourcing  is  an  example  of  this.
任何以特许经营或类似模式运营的行业（邮局）和任何外包行业就是一个例子。
If  a  supplier  fails,  other  suppliers  are  found within  the  time  it  takes  to  run  out  of  inventory.
如果某个供应商失败，则在库存耗尽的时间内找到其他供应商。
Similarly,  a  new  job  is  found before the emergency fund is depleted.
同样，在应急基金耗尽之前，也会找到一份新工作。
However, since the strategy is preset by society  (see  The  lock-in),  improvements  are  limited  to  tactics  such  as introducing  more  slack  through  reserve  funds,  using  the  proper  amount  of savings  and  insurance,  and  simply  running  the  operation  faster--hence  the fascination with lifehacking, productivity, time-saving strategies, and the almost fanatical  discussions  of  exactly  how  large  the  emergency  fund  should  be  and how much one should spend on each budget category.
然而，由于该战略是由社会预先设定的（参见[锁住]()），因此改进仅限于策略，如通过储备基金引入更多的闲置资金，使用适当数量的储蓄和保险，并简单地加快运营速度——因此对生活黑客、生产力、节省时间的战略，以及关于紧急基金到底应该有多少，以及每个预算类别应该花费多少的近乎狂热的讨论。

Now, knowing the difference between the categories is one thing, but if you have  ever  been  involved  in  a  start-up  or  gone  through  any  other  kind  of transformation,  you'll  know  that  the  underlying  thinking  and  feeling  of  the finished  stage  can  be  very  different  from  the  thinking  and  feeling  in  the intermediate  stage,  which  again  is  different  from  the  initial  stage,  exactly because it's a complex, nonlinear process.
现在，了解不同类别之间的差异是一回事，但如果你曾经参与过初创企业或经历过任何其他类型的转型，你会知道，完成阶段的潜在思维和感觉可能与中间阶段的思维和感觉非常不同，中间阶段的思维和感觉也不同于初始阶段，因为这是一个复杂的非线性过程。
Therefore, we'll now look at principles for creating the initial stage of consilience and resilience in a life strategy.
因此，我们现在来看看在生活策略初始阶段中创建一致性和弹性的原则。
