As mentioned in The lock-in, it is interesting that we refer to "primitive"
people27 as primitive, 

如在“锁住”章节提到的，我们把“原始的人”定义为原始是非常有意思的，

when every primitive person is able to build his own tools
and shelter, make his own clothes, provide heat and water, and knows what food
is edible and what isn't. 

当每一个原始人有能力建造自己的工具和庇护所，制作自己的衣服，提供温暖和水，知道哪些食物能吃哪些不能。

How many of us are capable of that?

我们中有多少人能做到这点？


 His technology
may be primitive, but his general knowledge of his world far surpasses ours. 

他的技术可能是原始的，但是在他的世界里他的通用知识是远胜于我们的。

A "primitive" can competently participate in every aspect of what his culture does.

一个“原始的人”能够完整地参与到他文化中的各个方面。

In contrast, we only know something about a very limited number of things in
our culture, 

作为对照，我们只知道我们文化中的非常有限的一点东西，

such as our job training and functions, and the only thing we share in
common are opinions about local restaurants, the fictitious lives of the characters
in  a  couple  of  TV  serials,  and  a  rudimentary  understanding  of  the  weather
forecast. 

随着我们的工作训练和进行，这仅有的一点常识性的东西也是关于当地饭馆，电视节目上的生活家具，对于天气预报的理解。

In that regard, our society is more akin to a highly developed insect
colony where specialized members work for the greater whole.

这就代表着，我们的社会更接近高度发展的群居昆虫，特化的个体为更好的整体工作。


Given the lack of diversity of individuals' skills, the popular measure of how
well we're doing is given by a single number: Our net worth, or salary for those
who don't have a net worth.

由于缺乏个人技能的多样性，评价我们的标准也被给定了一个单一的树脂：我们的网络的价值，对于那些没有网络价值的人来说则是薪水。

 Open any book on personal finance and one of the
first numbers introduced is the concept of net worth. 

打开任何一个关于个人财务的书籍，第一介绍的都是网络价值。


Your net worth is equal to
the sum of all your financial assets, house, investments, and possessions minus
the  sum  of  all  your  financial  liabilities,  mortgages,  and  loans. 

你的网络价值等于你的财产、房子、投资加和，然后减去财务负担、按揭、贷款。

 This  can  be
positive or negative, but it is still a one-dimensional number.

这或正或复，但它仍然是一维数字。

Net worth is only useful as a measuring stick if everybody plays the same
game and has the same form of consumption.

网络价值只有在玩同一游戏并且有相同消耗的时候，才能作为一个有用的测量尺。

 It is only useful in a world where
money is earned with one skill and the lack of all other skills is compensated for by spending money.

它只有在一个缺乏其他技能，只能用一种技能赚钱，然后比拼花钱的世界中有用。


However, real people, even specialists, are not so one-dimensional. 

然而，真正的人，即使是专业人士，也不知是一维的。

A person
may be able to cook his own food (reheating pizzas or boiling noodles is not
cooking!). 

一个人能够自己做饭（加热披萨和煮面条不算！）。

 Compared  to  a  person  that  needs  to  go  out  to  eat  or  buy  more
expensive preprocessed food, that skill is an asset, because the person needs less
money to eat.

和那些需要到外面吃或者买昂贵加工食品的人比，这项技能是财产，因为吃饭可以花更少的钱。

 Yet how does one put a price on this asset?28 Similarly, a person
with a high-paying job may be chronically stressed or sedentary and thus at a
higher risk of developing various lifestyle diseases. Yet how does one put a price
on this liability?
It may not be possible to put a precise price on such assets and liabilities, but
it's  possible  to  draw  a  diagram  that  illustrates  them.  This  figure  shows  the
scenario  for  a  locked-in  person  as  described  in  The lock-in.  On  the  x-axis is
shown various areas of a person's life--working, living, eating, etc. Also shown
is a dashed line that demarcates areas where the person is paying and where the
person is getting paid. A locked-in person has almost no useful skills. The one
skill  they  do  have  provides  all  of  their  income.  Consequently,  a  locked-in
specialist gets paid for only a single area, but he is paid a lot, as the tall spike
indicates. This is the same spike as in this figure. Yet all other areas are below
the dashed line, indicating that those areas must be paid for.

This figure shows the degree of skills for a locked-in person. The
dashed line demarcates the point where a person neither spends nor receives
money. In other words, the person is able to do this activity for free. Notice
that for the locked-in person, most activities cost money. These activities
are all supported by a single skill-based income.
Contrast this with a person who has multiple personal skill-assets, as in this
figure. While there may not be time to develop a skill to the same remunerative
level as the specialist, he nevertheless compensates by being able to earn some
income in several areas while needing less money in other areas, because he's
able to do some work himself and to shop for lower prices. This is a person who
is less dependent on the market system than the specialist. It's a person for whom
net worth is less relevant. In extreme cases, money may even be irrelevant.

This figure shows the degree of skills for a Renaissance man. Notice
how he pays very little for most activities. Also notice how he's able to
derive money from several activities.
It is curious that experts recommend that investments be broadly diversified,
while  at  the  same  time  recommending  that  job  skills  should  be  highly
concentrated. The Renaissance man has a lot of diversified human capital, but it
will  be  difficult,  though  not  impossible,  to  sell  it  on  a  market  tailored  for
specialists. Selling isn't the point, though. Rather than focusing on how to sell,
it's often more efficient to focus on how not to buy! And a wide assortment of
skills can substitute for a lot of otherwise required income.
According to experts on expertise (yes, there is such as thing!), it takes 1,000
hours of focused effort to be considered competent in a subject, 3,000 hours to
master  it,  and  10,000  hours  to  become  an  expert  (see  Gauging  mastery).29
Considering that the average person spends four hours a day or almost 1,500
hours  a  year  watching  TV  or  playing  computer  games,  it  is  not  an
insurmountable task over a period of years to become an expert in a field while
simultaneously  becoming  competent  in  several  other  fields,  perhaps  even
mastering one of them.
Which skills should one focus on? The Renaissance men of the 17th century
strove to increase their ability to
defend themselves with a variety of weapons.
play a variety of musical instruments and paint.
debate politics and philosophy.
advance knowledge and the sciences.
be an accomplished author and poet

For  our  modern  purposes,  the  fields  can  perhaps  be  grouped  into  seven
generic  fields--physiological,  economical,  intellectual,  emotional,  social,
technical, and ecological. Initially, it may seem overwhelming to master such a
wide  array  of  subjects,  and  perhaps  the  idea  is  even  incompatible  with  your
personal preferences. However, the universal ideal doesn't require total mastery
of a subject; it only aspires to it. Keep in mind that effort and results are not
linearly  related  over  the  entire  range  (see  Sigmoids,  logistic  curves,  and  the
maximum  power  principle  and  this  figure).  Ideally,  effort  should  be  spread
equally between all subjects, though due to personal preferences and talents a
person may decide to focus more on some areas than others.
