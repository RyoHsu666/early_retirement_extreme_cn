Bartering  and  swapping  work  best  with  what  could  be  considered "differentiated  commodities"  such  as  CDs,  books,  board  games,  computer games, etc.

These things are all different in degree but very similar in kind (a CD is  a  CD),  and  joining  a  network  is  a  great  way  to  get  new  media.

Once  you develop some skill in networking and bartering, you'll begin to pay attention to the needs of other people and whether you can fulfill them with items you have.

At this point you may want to barter your excess items for food or services, to reduce your stuff.
