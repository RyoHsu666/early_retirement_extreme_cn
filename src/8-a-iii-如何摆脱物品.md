It's  hard  to  determine  where  everybody  got  the  bright  idea  to  turn  their houses into warehouses, but a very simple solution to this problem is to move all unused  possessions  into  a  storage  unit,  which  is  better  suited  for  the  purpose.

This  problem  is  relatively  easy  to  solve,  but  is  perhaps  best  attacked  during  a relocation.

Go  through  all  your  possessions.

For  each  possession,  each  book, each tool, each appliance, each toy, try to recall when you last used it and put it into one of the following categories.

It's important to be honest.

To avoid ruining the statistics, a box with 500 nails should be counted as one possession, whereas your  stack  of  plates  doesn't  count  as  one  stack  of  plates.

You'll  likely  be  using only  one  plate  at  a  time  with  all  other  plates  being  for  either  guests  or  to supplement the stack of unwashed dishes in the sink.

Be reasonable.

1.  I used this today (keep it).
1.
2.  I used this within the past week (keep it).
2.
3.  I used this within the past month (keep it).
3.
4.  I used this within the past six months (get rid of it).
4.
5.  I used this within the past year (get rid of it).
5.
6.  It has been more than a year since I used this (get rid of it!).
6.
7.  I did not even know I owned this?! (get rid of it!!)
7.

If  you  draw  a  histogram  it  might  look  something  like  this  figure. 

Don't  be surprised if you use fewer than three percent of your possessions daily and 90%+ of  all  possessions less  than  annually. 

This  is  a  normal  consumer  pattern,  but  a waste of space and money. 

The  goal  is  to  bunch  the  histogram  up  on  the  left-hand  side,  so  that  most possessions are used daily, with fewer possessions used weekly, only a few used monthly, and only a couple of keepsakes that rarely see any use. 

Usually one's possessions  will  then  fit  into  one  or  two  suitcases  (see  Which  things  should  I own?).

his graph shows a histogram that illustrates the number of possessions versus their usage. 

The x-axis shows the time since last use intervals and the y-axis shows the number of possessions in this category. 


To  make the  transition,  anything  that  falls  outside  of  this pattern should go into storage. 

In the US people have so much stuff that one can rent commercial storage  units. 

In  other  parts  of  the  world  one  has  to  come  to  some  sort  of arrangement with people who will rent out attic or shed space or store things for free. 


This process is most easily accomplished when relocating and things have to come out of the closet, perhaps seeing daylight for the first time in a long time. 

Plan  on  relocating  to  a  smaller  home. 

While  packing,  sort  things  into  moving boxes according to the list above. 

Put categories 1-3 into a few suitcases--if you need more than that, you're probably cheating--and put the rest in boxes headed to storage. 


Speaking of relocating to a smaller home, make sure to plan for things that are  important  to  you. 

For  instance,  if  you  like  to  read,  get  a  home  close  to  the library. 

This  way  you  can  use  the  public  library  as  your  library  rather  than duplicating the books in your home. 

In fact, one of the strategies I've used is to check whether a book I own is available through the library. 

If it is, I sell it, swap it, or give it away. 


If going through this process while staying in the same home, one will find a lot of space liberated. 

This will make cleaning and maintenance easier. 

It might also make you question why you live in such a big house (it looks so empty!). 

Please resist the temptation to fill the house with new stuff. 


A more lengthy process is to get rid of things slowly rather than putting them into  storage. 

I  don't  think  this  is  an  optimal  solution;  see  Sigmoids,  logistic curves, and the maximum power principle for why. 

Most likely, the process will be too slow and will subsequently stall out of bitterness over the fact that things don't appear to change despite all efforts. 

The cost of moving slowly towards a goal is that one needs a long time to get anywhere. 

This requires more discipline and dedication. 

In other words, there is a tradeoff between making sudden, large changes and being dedicated to incremental change. 

Only you will know which one fits you better. 


However, a slower process allows more maneuvering space. 

Rather than just putting  things  into  storage,  things  can  be  thrown  out,  given  away,  exchanged, swapped,  or  sold. 

With  the  Internet,  this  is  much  easier  to  facilitate. 

In  my experience, the question of whether to give, trade, or sell depends on the value of the item. 

If the item has no use value whatsoever, it should probably be thrown out or recycled for parts. 

Fortunately, consumer society has a very good service level  when  it  comes  to  throwing  things  out. 

In  principle,  you  could  throw everything in a dumpster. 

In fact, some people do this--other people live off this bounty through dumpster diving.
