For fuel you need a certain combination of amino acids, carbohydrates and essential  fats  (see  Building blocks).93  These  can  be  acquired  in  a  multitude  of ways and from different ingredients. 

The ingredients can be combined in various ways--recipes. 

It's noted that recipes also follow general principles and that it's worthwhile  to  learn  these  principles. 

For  example,  baking  involves  a  grain product (typically flour), liquid (typically water or milk), butter, yeast or baking soda,  combined  with  a  sour  product,  butter,  and  a  sweetener  (sugar,  honey, molasses,  etc.). 

Practically  any  baked  product  can  be  made  out  of  these ingredients and they each serve a very specific purpose in that certain types of bread,  muffin,  or  cake  will  always  have  some  of  them  but  not  others. 

A  little experimenting will reveal this. 

Just remember that flour and liquids are always needed;  anything  else  is  optional. 

Similarly,  combining  ingredients  usually requires  some  form  of  utensil  or  appliance--for  example,  a  knife,  a  bowl,  a spoon, an oven, a burner, etc. 

This  means  that  the  entire  process  of  following  specific  recipes  and  using specific  utensils  and  appliances  to  combine  specific  ingredients  into  specific meals  which  supply  all  the  required  nutrients  builds  a  complex  system  (see Building  blocks),  which  provides  flexibility  and  room  for  optimization  (see Construction methods).
