To  (re)build  a  wardrobe,  take  a  piece  of  paper  and  list  all  your  items  of clothing, spreading the items out over the paper as in this figure: "Blue shirt with print," "Black jeans #1," "Black socks #1," "Red sweater," "Green sweater," etc.

Now create one outfit by drawing lines, for example, "black jeans #1" to "black socks" to "blue shirt" forms a closed geometric shape (a triangle) and constitutes one outfit.

It will be easier to match colors, at least for a guy like me, if you just stick to black,  navy,  and  grey.

These  colors  go  well  with  each  other  and  almost everything else.

Continue this exercise, but only connect things you'd be willing to wear or are in fact wearing regularly as per this list.

At the end, you'll notice that  some  items  connect  to  many  other  items.

Those  are  the  central  pieces  of your  wardrobe.

Other  items,  like  that  hideous  sweater  from  Aunt  Martha,  are fairly  unconnected.

Yet  other  items  have  duplicates  which  serve  the  same function.

The most efficient wardrobe is the one with the largest ratio of outfits to items of clothing.

76 Add or remove items of clothing accordingly.

You can use the methods in How to get rid of things to get rid of clothes.

Now  determine  how  many  outfits  you  need;  in  our  society  six  is  typically sufficient--one for each day of the work week and one for the weekend, although if you can convince your colleagues that you still wash your clothes, you can go with  fewer.

If  following  fashion  is  important  to  you,  consider  that  the  average piece of clothing lasts about 100 wash cycles.

Better clothes may last 200 cycles.

If  washing  is  the  primary  source  of  failure,  the  amount  of  clothes  should  be balanced  to  wear  out  by  the  time  it  becomes  unfashionable.

This  amount  is determined by Lanchester's Square Law.

For example, 10 average shirts that get washed after wearing them for a day give 1,000 washes total.

They would last a little under 3 years  given equal  amount  of  wear.

If  shirt  fashion  changes  faster than this, 10 shirts is too many.

As clothes can take up a lot of space, you may want to reduce the size of your wardrobe to keep other things in your closet, or to simply require less closet space in the first place.
