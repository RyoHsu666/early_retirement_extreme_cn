To  (re)build  a  wardrobe,  take  a  piece  of  paper  and  list  all  your  items  of clothing, spreading the items out over the paper as in this figure: "Blue shirt with print," "Black jeans #1," "Black socks #1," "Red sweater," "Green sweater," etc.
要（重新）打造一个衣柜，拿一张纸列出你所有的衣服，将这些衣服铺在纸上，如下图所示：“蓝色印花衬衫”、“黑色牛仔裤”、“黑色袜子”、“红色毛衣”、“绿色毛衣”等。
Now create one outfit by drawing lines, for example, "black jeans #1" to "black socks" to "blue shirt" forms a closed geometric shape (a triangle) and constitutes one outfit.
现在通过画线来创建一套服装，例如，“黑色牛仔裤#1”到“黑色袜子”到“蓝色衬衫”形成一个闭合的几何形状（三角形），并构成一套服装。

It will be easier to match colors, at least for a guy like me, if you just stick to black,  navy,  and  grey.
如果你只选择黑色、海军蓝和灰色，至少对我这样的人来说，配色会更容易。
These  colors  go  well  with  each  other  and  almost everything else.
这些颜色和其他几乎所有颜色都很搭配。
Continue this exercise, but only connect things you'd be willing to wear or are in fact wearing regularly as per this list.
继续这个练习，但只根据这个列表连接你愿意穿的或事实上经常穿的衣服。
At the end, you'll notice that  some  items  connect  to  many  other  items.
最后，你会注意到一些项目连接到许多其他项目。
Those  are  the  central  pieces  of your  wardrobe.
这些是你衣柜的核心部分。
Other  items,  like  that  hideous  sweater  from  Aunt  Martha,  are fairly  unconnected.
其他的东西，比如玛莎姨妈送的那件难看的毛衣，是完全没有关联的。
Yet  other  items  have  duplicates  which  serve  the  same function.
然而，其他物品也有相同功能的复制品。
The most efficient wardrobe is the one with the largest ratio of outfits to items of clothing.76 
效率最高的衣柜是衣物使用比例最大的衣柜。
Add or remove items of clothing accordingly.
据此添加或移除衣物。
You can use the methods in How to get rid of things to get rid of clothes.
你可以使用[如何摆脱物品]()中的方法来摆脱衣服。

Now  determine  how  many  outfits  you  need;  in  our  society  six  is  typically sufficient--one for each day of the work week and one for the weekend, although if you can convince your colleagues that you still wash your clothes, you can go with  fewer.
现在确定你需要多少装备；在我们的社会中，六件衣服通常就足够了——一周工作的每一天一件，周末一件。不过，如果你能说服同事你仍然在洗衣服，你就可以少拥有一些。
If  following  fashion  is  important  to  you,  consider  that  the  average piece of clothing lasts about 100 wash cycles.
如果跟随时尚对你来说很重要，那么平均衣服寿命大约为100次洗涤周期。
Better clothes may last 200 cycles.
更好的衣服可以穿200次。
If  washing  is  the  primary  source  of  failure,  the  amount  of  clothes  should  be balanced  to  wear  out  by  the  time  it  becomes  unfashionable.
如果洗涤是损坏的主要原因，那么衣服的数量应该保持平衡，以便在衣服过时时穿坏。
This  amount  is determined by Lanchester's Square Law.
这个量是由兰彻斯特平方定律决定的。
For example, 10 average shirts that get washed after wearing them for a day give 1,000 washes total.
例如，平均 10 件衬衫在穿了一天后会被洗掉，总共需要洗 1000 次。
They would last a little under 3 years  given equal  amount  of  wear.
如果磨损量相同，它们的使用寿命将略低于3年。
If  shirt  fashion  changes  faster than this, 10 shirts is too many.
如果衬衫时尚的变化比这更快，那么10件衬衫就太多了。
As clothes can take up a lot of space, you may want to reduce the size of your wardrobe to keep other things in your closet, or to simply require less closet space in the first place.
由于衣服可能会占用大量空间，你可能想缩小衣柜的尺寸，以便在衣柜中存放其他物品，或者只是减少衣柜空间。
