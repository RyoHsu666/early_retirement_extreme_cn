Most career people's lives are dominated by schedules and procedures. They
get up at the same time every day. They take the same route to work and sit at
the same desk and do the same things day-in and day-out for many years. At the
end of the day, they go back along the same route. They have various chores and
activities  scheduled  until  they  go  to  bed  at  the  same  time.  Maybe  they
occasionally go to a restaurant, the movies, or a sports event. Weekends are like
evenings--structured  around  chores  that  didn't  get  done  during  the  week,  like
laundry, cleaning, and sleeping. Vacations are arranged in the same manner--if
not taken between job transitions, vacations are spent a few days here and there
as people spend one day traveling and then frantically go around and try to see
everything they want to see before they head back, exhausted. The reward for
running on this treadmill occurs not through the satisfaction of doing a good job,
but from the semimonthly paycheck.
Similarly, much effort goes into spending money. Money is spent as a reward
for the drudgery, but also because people perceive that there's nothing better to
do with it. Often, money is spent in the most inefficient way possible, by using
credit cards, then making minimum payments, thus paying for the item twice
over  in  interest  alone.  Enjoyment  is  often  limited  to  buying  things  because
there's no time to use them, since the buyer has to get back to work and earn
more money. Measured in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) growth, this
cycle is highly productive, but it could be argued that the net effect is not very
productive at all. Thanks to advertising, nobody knows when enough is enough,
even though running out of space in the garage should serve as an indication.
Material wants are universally believed to be infinite in scope.
On top of that, everyone seems to want a cut of your earnings. The harder
you work, the greater the cut. The tax authorities want their cut, and the more
you work, the more they want. People want money to manage the money you
don't spend, and money to take care of the things that you don't have time to take
care of yourself. This requires more work and, hence, even more costs in terms
of day care, business clothes wear and tear, expensive haircuts, power lunches,
and snack bars. People run harder and harder but somehow don't seem to get
ahead, continuously bleeding money as luxuries become wants, wants becomes
habits, and habits become needs, and so they slowly die a financial death by a
thousand nibbling ducks.
Living to work and spend, it's not surprising that people derive their main

identity through their job title and their purchases: "What do you do for a living
and  which  brand  names  do  you  buy  to  express  your  lifestyle?"  Despite  a
doubling  of  productivity  over  the  past  two  generations,  our  culture  is  still
perpetuating the old ritual of eight hours of work, eight hours of sleep and eight
hours of spare time, even though this should have been reduced to four hours of
work, eight hours of sleep and 12 hours of spare time by now. Maybe people are
just doing what they have been told to do by parents, friends, politicians, and
others. There is massive stigma associated with occupying one's time with things
other  than  working  and  buying  advertised  goods.11  A  tremendous  amount  of
effort goes into career advancement, to earn more money and buy more stuff.
Countless books are written and many workshops are given on how to stay late
to appear dedicated, how to leave early to appear efficient, where to sit and how
to sit, how often and loud to speak at meetings to be noticed by the boss, how to
handle  performance  reviews,  and  how  to  worry  about  other  things  that  are
essentially beyond your control anyway and thus cause a lot of stress. Similarly,
experts explain which questions are asked in a job interview, which responses to
give for the best impression, and how to word a résumé so that it'll stand out
amongst  the  hundreds  of  other  résumés  that  follow  exactly  the  same  advice.
While  such  advice  appears  to  be  helpful,  it  only  serves  to  increase  the
competitive pressure. It's just like Hardin's Tragedy of the Commons. In turn,
employers make a big deal out of finding employees with the right fit, people
who either learn or are naturally talented at playing the games of the system. The
nascent  consumer  should  already  have  had  practice  at  fitting  in  and  being
popular from high school. In fact, high school athletics is a good preparation for
today's corporate world due to importance of "team play." Similarly "having no
life" (nothing wrong with that, but you know what I mean) is a good preparation
for life in academia.
The Darwinian "survival of the fittest" often has undertones of "survival of
the best," a belief that the "fittest" are happy to reinforce. The distinction should
not be forgotten, though. In competitive environments, the selection isn't for the
best but for those that best fit the environment. People are not selected for the
best attributes, they're selected for the fittest attributes. A world without trees
selects the short-necked giraffe, which  is  better  adapted.  Similarly,  the  career
track selects people who are willing to give up their lives for the sake of work.
Most  promotions  are  governed12  by  the  requirement  for  seniority.  This
means that a superior has to be promoted, retired, or fired before an inferior can
be promoted. Naturally, this predictable trajectory of promotions is subject to
demographics.  Hence,  if  you  want  a  good  estimate  of  your  career  prospects,

have  a  look  at  the  birth  rate  as  a  function  of  time.  Also,  during  periods  of
economic growth and  rapid  expansion,  promotion  is  much  easier  than  during
periods  of  contraction  or  stagnation.  If  you  ever  wondered  why  your  boss  is
incompetent or why it's so hard for you to advance, chances are that he started
his career during a period of economic expansion, which required scraping the
bottom  for  all  the  new  positions  to  be  filled,  while  you  didn't,  relatively
speaking.
Salaried wages lead to an employer preference for longer work hours. Also,
employers  have  fixed  costs  and  thus  prefer  workers  to  work  the  capitalized
assets as hard as possible. By paying higher wages and limiting the number of
jobs  on  high  salaries,  employers  can  make  workers  compete  for  these  jobs.
Advancement doesn't work on the model of a ladder as much as on that of a
pyramid. As workers spend more time on the job, it leads to a dependence on the
job, since little time can be spent on alternative pursuits. Having several income
streams is in fact highly dangerous to worker motivation. This is why capital
income is generally cordoned off into special retirement accounts with penalties
for  withdrawal.  This  is  also  why  many  employers  discourage  workers  from
working competing or even noncompeting jobs. In addition, debt plays a major
role in locking people into working for most of their lives. It used to be that
marriage was seen as a lock-in: Unlike a bachelor, a husband would need a job to
take care of his dependents. Today this is no longer the case and being single is
more of a lock-in since the family income isn't diversified by a working spouse.
A consumer life is one of intense specialization. Most do a single job without
much concern for the greater whole. This is why such great importance is placed
on  fitting  in  and  being  a  team  player.  Conversely,  it  also  means  that  few
participants in society really have or attempt any understanding of larger issues
like  climate  change,  geopolitics,  and  population  issues,  or  why,  despite  our
advances  in  technology,  we  still  work  as  hard  as  our  grandparents  did.  Such
problems are typically left to "them," but do "they," the experts, really know
what they're doing?
