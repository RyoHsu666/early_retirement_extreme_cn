Most career people's lives are dominated by schedules and procedures. 
大多数职业人士的生活，都受到日程安排和程序的支配。
They get up at the same time every day. 
他们每天在同一时间起床。
They take the same route to work and sit at the same desk and do the same things day-in and day-out for many years. 
多年来，他们走同样的路线上班，坐在同一张办公桌前，日复一日地做同样的事情。
At the end of the day, they go back along the same route. 
一天结束时，他们沿着同一条路线返回。
They have various chores and activities  scheduled  until  they  go  to  bed  at  the  same  time. 
他们安排了各种家务和活动，直到他们同时上床睡觉。
 Maybe  they occasionally go to a restaurant, the movies, or a sports event. 
也许他们偶尔会去餐厅、看电影或看体育赛事。
Weekends are like evenings--structured  around  chores  that  didn't  get  done  during  the  week,  like laundry, cleaning, and sleeping. 
周末就像晚上——围绕着一周内没有完成的家务活，比如洗衣、清洁和睡觉。
Vacations are arranged in the same manner--if not taken between job transitions, vacations are spent a few days here and there as people spend one day traveling and then frantically go around and try to see everything they want to see before they head back, exhausted. 
假期也以同样的方式安排——如果不是在换工作之间，假期就会在这里或那里度过几天，精疲力尽，因为人们花了一整天的时间旅行，疯狂地四处走动，在他们回去之前，试图看到他们想看到的一切。
The reward for running on this treadmill occurs not through the satisfaction of doing a good job, but from the semimonthly paycheck.
在这台跑步机上跑步的回报，不是来自做好工作的满足感，而是来自每半月的薪水。

Similarly, much effort goes into spending money. 
同样，很多精力都用在了花钱上。
Money is spent as a reward for the drudgery, but also because people perceive that there's nothing better to do with it. 
花钱是对苦差事的奖励，也是因为，人们认为没有什么比这更好的了。
Often, money is spent in the most inefficient way possible, by using credit cards, then making minimum payments, thus paying for the item twice over  in  interest  alone. 
通常，金钱是以最低效的方式花费的，即通过信用卡，进行最低还款额，使支付的利息就是本金的两倍。
 Enjoyment  is  often  limited  to  buying  things  because there's no time to use them, since the buyer has to get back to work and earn more money. 
由于没有时间使用它们，享受通常仅限于购买东西，因为买家必须重新工作并赚更多的钱。
Measured in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) growth, this cycle is highly productive, but it could be argued that the net effect is not very productive at all. 
以国内生产总值 (GDP) 增长衡量，这个周期的生产力很高，但可以说，净效应根本不是很有生产力。
Thanks to advertising, nobody knows when enough is enough, even though running out of space in the garage should serve as an indication.
Material wants are universally believed to be infinite in scope.
多亏了广告，没有人知道什么时候是足够，即使车库中的空间不足，应该可以作为一个指示。
人们普遍认为物质需求的范围是无限的。

On top of that, everyone seems to want a cut of your earnings. 
最重要的是，每个人似乎都希望减少你的收入。
The harder you work, the greater the cut. 
你工作得越努力，削减就越大。
The tax authorities want their cut, and the more you work, the more they want. 
税务机关想要收税，你工作的越多，他们想收的就越多。
People want money to manage the money you don't spend, and money to take care of the things that you don't have time to take care of yourself. 
有人想收钱来管理你没有花的钱，想收钱来处理你没有时间照顾的事情。
This requires more work and, hence, even more costs in terms of day care, business clothes wear and tear, expensive haircuts, power lunches, and snack bars. 
在日托、商务套装磨损、昂贵的理发、强力午餐、小吃店方面的成本甚至更高，这需要更多的工作。
People run harder and harder but somehow don't seem to get ahead, continuously bleeding money as luxuries become wants, wants becomes habits, and habits become needs, and so they slowly die a financial death by a thousand nibbling ducks.
人们越跑越努力，但不知何故，似乎并没有取得进展，随着奢侈品变成需要，欲望变成习惯，习惯变成需要，被一千只鸭子啃食，他们不断地流血，慢慢地在经济上死亡。

Living to work and spend, it's not surprising that people derive their main identity through their job title and their purchases: "What do you do for a living and  which  brand  names  do  you  buy  to  express  your  lifestyle?"  Despite a doubling  of  productivity  over  the  past  two  generations,  our  culture is  still perpetuating the old ritual of eight hours of work, eight hours of sleep and eight hours of spare time, even though this should have been reduced to four hours of work, eight hours of sleep and 12 hours of spare time by now. 
为了工作和消费而生活，人们通过他们的职位和购买，获得他们的主要身份也就不足为奇了。“你为生活了做什么，你购买哪些品牌来表达你的生活方式？” 尽管过去两代人的生产力翻了一番，但我们的文化仍在延续8小时工作、8小时睡眠和8小时业余时间的旧习惯，尽管这本应减少到4小时工作，8小时的睡眠和12小时的业余时间。
Maybe people are just doing what they have been told to do by parents, friends, politicians, and others. 
也许人们只是在做父母、朋友、政治家、其他人告诉他们要做的事情。
There is massive stigma associated with occupying one's time with things other  than  working  and  buying  advertised  goods.11 
把时间花在工作和购买广告商品之外的事情上，会带来巨大的耻辱。
A  tremendous  amount  of effort goes into career advancement, to earn more money and buy more stuff.
大量的努力用于职业发展，以赚取更多的钱并购买更多的东西。
Countless books are written and many workshops are given on how to stay late to appear dedicated, how to leave early to appear efficient, where to sit and how to sit, how often and loud to speak at meetings to be noticed by the boss, how to handle  performance  reviews,  and  how  to  worry  about  other  things  that  are essentially beyond your control anyway and thus cause a lot of stress. 
写了无数的书，举办了无数讲习班，讲授如何熬夜以表现出专注，如何早退以表现出高效，在哪里坐以及如何坐，在会议上讲话的频率和音量以引起老板的注意，如何处理绩效评估，以及如何担心其他基本上超出你控制范围的事情，这些都造成很大压力。
Similarly, experts explain which questions are asked in a job interview, which responses to give for the best impression, and how to word a résumé so that it'll stand out amongst  the  hundreds  of  other  résumés  that  follow  exactly  the  same  advice.
While  such  advice  appears  to  be  helpful,  it  only  serves  to  increase  the competitive pressure. 
同样，专家会解释在求职面试中会问哪些问题，哪些回答会给人留下最好的印象，以及如何用简历措辞，以使其，在数百份完全遵循相同建议的简历中脱颖而出。
虽然这样的建议似乎有帮助，但它只会增加竞争压力。
It's just like Hardin's Tragedy of the Commons. 
这就像加勒特·哈丁的公地悲剧一样。
In turn, employers make a big deal out of finding employees with the right fit, people who either learn or are naturally talented at playing the games of the system. 
反过来，雇主在寻找合适的员工方面很划算，这些员工在这套游戏系统里，有学习和参与的天赋。
The nascent  consumer  should  already  have  had  practice  at  fitting  in  and  being popular from high school. 
初出茅庐的消费者从高中就开始适应起来了。
In fact, high school athletics is a good preparation for today's corporate world due to importance of "team play." 
Similarly "having no life" (nothing wrong with that, but you know what I mean) is a good preparation for life in academia.
The Darwinian "survival of the fittest" often has undertones of "survival of the best," a belief that the "fittest" are happy to reinforce. 
事实上，由于“团队合作”的重要性，高中体育运动是在为企业界做好准备。
同样，“没有生活”（这没有错，但你知道我的意思）是为学术界的生活做好准备。
达尔文的“适者生存”常常带有“优胜劣汰”的意味，这是一种“适者生存”的信念。
The distinction should not be forgotten, though. 
所以，记住这些区别。
In competitive environments, the selection isn't for the best but for those that best fit the environment. 
在竞争激烈的环境中，选择的不是最好的，而是最适合环境的。
People are not selected for the best attributes, they're selected for the fittest attributes. 
人们不是因为最好的属性被选中，而是因为最适合的属性被选中。
A world without trees selects the short-necked giraffe, which  is  better  adapted. 
一个没有树木的世界，选择了更适应的短颈长颈鹿。
 Similarly,  the  career track selects people who are willing to give up their lives for the sake of work.
同样，职业轨道选择的，是愿意为工作而放弃生命的人。

Most  promotions  are  governed12  by  the  requirement  for  seniority. 
大多数晋升都受到资历要求的约束。
 This means that a superior has to be promoted, retired, or fired before an inferior can be promoted. 
这意味着，在晋升下级之前，必须提升、退休或解雇上级。
Naturally, this predictable trajectory of promotions is subject to demographics. 
当然，这种可预测的晋升轨迹，受人口统计数据的影响。
 Hence,  if  you  want  a  good  estimate  of  your  career  prospects,have  a  look  at  the  birth  rate  as  a  function  of  time. 
因此，如果你想对你的职业前景有一个更好的估计，看看出生率作为时间轴的函数。
 Also,  during  periods  of economic growth and  rapid  expansion,  promotion  is  much  easier  than  during periods  of  contraction  or  stagnation. 
此外，在经济增长和快速扩张时期，晋升比在收缩或停滞时期容易得多。
 If  you  ever  wondered  why  your  boss  is incompetent or why it's so hard for you to advance, chances are that he started his career during a period of economic expansion, which required scraping the bottom  for  all  the  new  positions  to  be  filled,  while  you  didn't,  relatively speaking.
如果你曾经想过，为什么你的老板不称职，或者为什么你很难晋升，很可能他是在经济扩张时期开始他的职业生涯的，这时期需要拔高来填补为新职的空缺，而你相对而言没有赶上。

Salaried wages lead to an employer preference for longer work hours. 
受薪工资导致雇主偏好更长的工作时间。
Also, employers  have  fixed  costs  and  thus  prefer  workers  to  work  the  capitalized assets as hard as possible. 
此外，雇主有固定成本，因此更喜欢工人最大化使用资本化资产。
By paying higher wages and limiting the number of jobs  on  high  salaries,  employers  can  make  workers  compete  for  these  jobs.
Advancement doesn't work on the model of a ladder as much as on that of a pyramid. 
通过支付更高的工资，和限制高薪工作的数量，雇主可以让工人竞争这些工作。
进步在梯子模型上并不像在金字塔模型上那样有效。
As workers spend more time on the job, it leads to a dependence on the job, since little time can be spent on alternative pursuits. 
随着工人在工作上花费更多的时间，很少有时间可以花在其他的追求上，它会导致对工作的依赖。
Having several income streams is in fact highly dangerous to worker motivation. 
实际上，拥有多个收入来源，对员工的积极性是非常危险的。
This is why capital income is generally cordoned off into special retirement accounts with penalties for  withdrawal. 
这就是为什么资本收入，通常被封锁在特殊的退休账户中，并对提款进行处罚。
 This  is  also  why  many  employers  discourage  workers  from working competing or even noncompeting jobs. 
这也是为什么，许多雇主不鼓励工人从事竞争性，甚至非竞争性工作的原因。
In addition, debt plays a major role in locking people into working for most of their lives. 
此外，债务，将人们一生大部分时间锁定在工作上方面，起着重要作用。
It used to be that marriage was seen as a lock-in: Unlike a bachelor, a husband would need a job to take care of his dependents. 
过去，婚姻被视为一种锁定：与单身汉不同，丈夫需要一份工作来照顾他的家属。
Today this is no longer the case and being single is more of a lock-in since the family income isn't diversified by a working spouse.
如今，情况已不再如此，单身更像是一种锁定，因为家庭收入不会因一个工作配偶而多样化。

A consumer life is one of intense specialization. 
消费生活是一种高度专业化的生活。
Most do a single job without much concern for the greater whole. 
大多数人只做一项工作，而不太关心更大的整体。
This is why such great importance is placed on  fitting  in  and  being  a  team  player. 
这就是为什么如此重视融入，和成为团队成员的原因。
 Conversely,  it  also  means  that  few participants in society really have or attempt any understanding of larger issues like  climate  change,   geopolitics,  and  population  issues,  or  why,  despite  our advances  in  technology,  we  still  work  as  hard  as  our  grandparents  did. 
相反，这也意味着社会中很少有人，真正了解或尝试了解气候变化、地缘政治、人口问题等更大的问题，或者为什么我们的技术进步了，我们仍然像祖父母那样努力工作。
 Such problems are typically left to "them," but do "they," the experts, really know what they're doing?
 这些问题通常留给“他们”来处理，但“他们”，专家们，真的知道他们在做什么吗？
