The need for a kitchen and its particular configuration is determined by diet.

Even the  need for particular kitchen  appliances  is  determined  by diet.

Eating  a mostly or exclusively raw diet eliminates the range oven and replaces it with a blender and a juicer.

The need for a refrigerator is determined by your location.

If you live close to a supermarket, you can simply store your food at the market rather than in your refrigerator.

On the other hand, the more inconvenient your location  is,  the  larger  the  refrigerator  you  need.

In  other  words,  if  you  were  a serious health nut, you could completely replace your kitchen with a blender.

If you  desire  some  variation,  simply  eat  somewhere  else  once  in  a  while.

If  you desire  some  warm  food  for  a  change,  bring  out  the  camping  stove.

There's  no need to own a range unless you use it every day.

You may even be lucky enough that your company offers a lunch buffet.

Make lunch your main meal and have a sandwich for dinner; no kitchen needed.
