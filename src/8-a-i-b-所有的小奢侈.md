It's quite interesting to note that by choosing to modify your behavior and
give up certain average but comparably incredibly expensive things like $20,000
cars or $50,000 for an extra bedroom, being able to afford, or more accurately,
having access to little luxuries becomes a source of pleasure.

有一点非常有意思，通过选择去改变你的行为，放弃一些平均但是比较起来极其昂贵的东西，比如2万美元的车或5万美元的额外卧室的房子，变得可以承担时，或更精确点说，可以获取一些小奢侈成了快乐之源。

 How about owning
one of the best pocket knives in the world, the Sebenza made by Chris Reeves?59

那拥有世界上最好的折叠刀怎么样？它是Chris Reeves打造的Sebenza。

Regardless of how much someone spends on a pocket knife, it doesn't get much
better than this.

不管别人在这把刀上花了多少钱，再也没有比这更好的了。

 The VitaMix blender retailing at more than $400 is similarly
considered one of the best blenders that money can buy. 

VitaMix搅拌器要卖超过400美元道理也是相同的，因为它被认为是钱能买到的最好的搅拌机。

Kuhn Rikon pressure
cookers are  in  the  same  league. 

Kuhn Rikon压力锅也在这个联盟里。

 All  of  these  are  in  a  league  that  is  typically
beyond what most people have heard of.

这个联盟里的所有成员大多数人都没有听说过。

 Why freeze in "normal" winter clothes
when you can wear expedition-quality clothes that are comfortable in a wider
range of temperatures and activities?

当你能穿一件质量过硬的衣服，可以在宽泛的温度范围里保持舒适时，为什么要穿一件“常规”的冬衣挨冻？

The  typical  objection  is  that  these  things  cost  10  times  more  than  what
someone "normally" would pay. 

这些东西的典型特征是其他“常规”的东西价格的10倍。

However, they also last at least 10 times longer,
so the cost isn't that high (see Depreciation schedules). 

然而，它们可以使用至少10被长的时间，所以总花费不是那么高（参见[折旧时间表]()）。

To wit, my boots are 13
years old and my jacket is 14 years old. 

不开玩笑地说，我的靴子穿了13年，我的夹克穿了14年了。

The cost over time is the same as a
cheap unit, but the utility is much higher. 

在使用期间整个费用很低，但是功效要高的多。

The choice is therefore between using
a high-quality item and rarely or never replacing it, or a typical, low-quality item
and replacing it often. 

选择是，一个高质量很少或从不替换的东西，还是，典型的，低质量经常替换的东西。

Choose the former even though fashion encourages the
latter!

选择前者即使时尚上鼓励大家选择后者！

 The great benefit in doing this is that one can slowly build up an inventory
of great items. 

这么做的好处是，一个人可以慢慢地积累一些好东西。

 Buy the coat one year. Next year buy the copper pans. Then buy
the tube amplifier. And so on. You can even think of such luxuries as inflation-
proof savings in lieu of precious metals.

今年买件大衣。转年买个铜锅。然后再买个功放。如此等等。你甚至可以把这种奢侈认为是原有材料的保值代替。

This  means  that  you  won't  have  a  complete  inventory  right  away,  yet  it's
better than buying a complete but cheap inventory or worse, borrowing to do so.

这也意味着你不会马上拥有一套完整的储备，而是比买了一套廉价但是很糟糕的完整的储备。

For now, use whatever you currently have. 

从现在开始，用你已有的东西。

When what you currently have breaks
down or wears out, replace it with something great. 

无论当前什么东西穿坏了或用坏了，用一些好东西替换它们。

Ideally, one would own one
coat, one pot, etc. 

理想情况下，一个人拥有一件大衣，一口锅等等。

and hand it down to the next generation rather than replacing it
every time fashion changes.

把它用到寿终正寝而不会跟着潮流每次都更换它。
