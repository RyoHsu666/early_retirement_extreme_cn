Instead of having a network and knowing who can fix a problem, we just pick up the phonebook, call someone, and pay them to fix the problem. 
和知道谁能解决问题的人际网络比，我们只是拿起电话簿，打电话给某人，然后付钱给他们解决问题。

This  lack  of  complex  social  structure  has  led  to  neighborhoods  where  each household  has  their  own  power  mower  that  they  use  for  15  minutes  a  week  to mow  their  postage  stamp-sized  lawn. 
由于缺乏复杂的社会结构，社区里的每个家庭都有自己的电动割草机，每周用15分钟来修剪邮票大小的草坪。
 Multiply  this  by  practically  every  other activity  that  people  now  do  alone  and  one  realizes  that  the  replacement  of community requires a tremendous amount of resources. 
将这一点乘以人们现在单独进行的几乎所有其他活动，人们就会意识到社区的替代需要巨大的资源。
Of course, this is great for business, but a person with some skill in creating a community can save a lot of resources and generate a lot of utility by connecting with people. 
当然，这对商业来说是很好的，但是一个在创建社区方面有一定技能的人，可以通过与人联系节省大量资源，并产生大量效用。
