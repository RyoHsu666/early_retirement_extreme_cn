Modern  societies  have  become  an  aggregation  of  individuals. 

 The  complex structures  that  hold  people  together  have  been  delegated  to  the  marketplace. 

Instead of having a network and knowing who can fix a problem, we just pick up the phonebook, call someone, and pay them to fix the problem. 

Unlike in the rest of the world, we have no social capital; only financial capital. 

This  lack  of  complex  social  structure  has  led  to  neighborhoods  where  each household  has  their  own  power  mower  that  they  use  for  15  minutes  a  week  to mow  their  postage  stamp-sized  lawn. 

 Multiply  this  by  practically  every  other activity  that  people  now  do  alone  and  one  realizes  that  the  replacement  of community requires a tremendous amount of resources. 

Of course, this is great for business, but a person with some skill in creating a community can save a lot of resources and generate a lot of utility by connecting with people.
