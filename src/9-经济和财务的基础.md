An ecosystem has four components, which form a cycle: Abiotic (resources),
producers, consumers, and decomposers. 

生态系统循环里有四个组件：无机物（养料）、生产者、消费者、分解者。

Modern economics only considers two
of  these  relevant:  producers  and  consumers. 

现代经济只考虑了其中的两个：生产者和消费者。

 It  ignores  the  finite103  abiotic
resources and presumes that their only limit is the producers' ability to turn them
into  commodities. 

它忽略了有限的资源，并且假设唯一的限制因素是，生产者能把它们变成商品。

 Similarly,  consumers  and  producers  ignore  decomposition.

相似的，消费者和生产者忽略了分解过程。

Once  our  waste  and  detritus  is  dumped  into  landfills,  lakes,  rivers,  and  the
atmosphere, and is out of sight, it is, for all intents and purposes, out of mind.

废弃物一经倾倒到土地、湖泊、河流、大气层里，它们就消失在视野以外了，并且被主观地忽视了。

Meanwhile,  the  finite  planet  is  running  out  of  its  finite  resources  (duh!)  and
pollution keeps increasing and is starting to bite back. 

与此同时，有限的土地耗尽资源，并且污染还在侵蚀土地。

Typically, the economists
solve  this  problem  by  waving  their  hands  and  mumbling  something  about
substitution  and  human  ingenuity. 

典型地，经济学家通过摆手和低语一些可替代物和人类的聪明才智，解决着这些问题，。

 However,  it's  obvious  that  our  cultural
paradigm is incomplete and that resources and decomposition capacity can no
longer be considered infinite.

然而，很明显，我们目前的文化习惯是和有限资源不相容的，分解容量也不能再认为是无限的了。

Naturally, the economy can't keep growing without killing itself if the cycle
isn't completed.

自然地，当生态圈不能完整循环时，继续增长，它不可能不崩溃。

 If the cycle is not completed, we're either going to run out of
resources or drown in pollution. 

如果循环不完整，我们要么耗尽资源，要么生活在污染里。

If a decision is made to solve this problem, the
size of the economy would be determined by how efficient the cycle is. 

如果想要解决这个问题，必须要考虑整个生态的循环总量和效率。

Given
the enormous size of the human population in relation to the renewable resource
base of  Earth, completing  this  cycle and  preventing leaks  will  be to  the  21st
century  what  the  Cold  War  was  to  the  20th  century. 

将已有的巨量的人类污染物转换成可重用的资源，完成这个循环并阻止泄露，这会对21世纪将像20世纪的冷战。

 In  this  book  we're  not
focused  on  the  necessary  policy  decisions,  but  rather  what  the  individual
decisions should be. 

这本书里，我们不关注必要的政策决定，而是个人需要做的。

An economic system has trophic levels like an ecosystem
with  groups  or  socioeconomic  strata  feeding  off  each  other. 

一个经济系统像生态系统一样，有群体之间互相饲养的营养等级。

 In  a  growth
economy, there are workers, organizers of workers, owners of assets, and owners
of land. In a complete ecology, there are abiotics,  producers,  consumers,  and
decomposers.

一个成长的经济体，有工人，组织者，财产所有者，地主。在一个完整的生态循环中，有营养物质，生产者，消费者，和分解者。

Humans  are  sufficiently  adaptable  to  execute  any  of  these  roles  in  either
system. 

人类非常能适应担当任何系统中的所有角色。

 Economic  decision-making  must  be  expanded  to  include  all  these
factors. 

经济学决策制定应该包含所有的因素。

Until such an understanding is codified into human behavior via law,
religion, and values, something that those who profit from the current setup are
not apt to do anytime soon, individuals need to act as if such a code already
existed, since economic decision-making eventually does catch up to reality. 

直到这种理解，通过法律，宗教，价值观融入到人类的行为当中，而当前阶段还没有实现这样，个体需要按照这些已经存在了活动，直到经济决策直到最终跟上现实。

The
economy has many unrecognized inefficiencies--it is, for example, possible for
more  people  to  play  the  role  of  decomposers  (recycling,  upcycling)  and
producers  as  well  as  becoming  less  dependent  on  abiotic  resources. 

经济系统还有未察觉很多无效率，例如，可能需要更多的人来扮演分解者（回收，分类），也需要更少依赖自然资源的生产者。

 The
challenge  is  to  do  this  within  the  existing  framework.  

挑战是在现存的框架里这么做。

Net  savings--lifetime
income  minus  lifetime  expenses--equals  a  person's  contribution  to  society. 

网络存储——有生之年的收入减去支出，等于一个人对社会的贡献。

 It
illustrates how much the person has given versus how much the person has taken
on  an  economic  basis,  as  measured  in  money. 

它展示了一个人从经济付出和收获了多少，也用钱来衡量。

 Using  the  saved  money,  it's
possible to acquire productive factors by trading. 

使用存款，在交易中就可以获得生产因素。

In a less specialized society,
imagine  having  spent  the  time  building  and  accumulating  tools  and  other
productive  factors  that  make  work  more  productive.  

在一个更少专业化的社会里，花时间建造和积累工具，和其他一些生产因素让工作更有效率。

The  same  society  also
allows  for  a  conversion  of  tools  back  into  money  for  spending.  

这个社会也允许将工具转换成钱来花掉。

It's  a  more
abstract way of arranging matters than building a shoe-making machine which is
capable of outputting a lifetime of shoes, rather than having it output a pair of
shoes every decade after the previous pair have worn out.

一个更抽象的解决问题方法是，建造一个能在生命周期生产鞋的机器，而不是每隔几年，旧写穿坏了再去生产一双新的。

 "Investing" is simply
the process of putting this idea into practice. 

“投资”就是将这个想法变成现实的方法。

An "investor" is thus a person who
lives from his assets. 

一个“投资人”就是一个靠他资产生活的人。

A capitalist is an "investor." A hunter-gatherer, who has a
way of life that has survived for tens of thousands of years, is to a large extent
also an "investor."

资本家是一个“投资人”。一个采集狩猎者，这个已经幸存了上万年的生活方式，也是“投资人”的一种扩展。

 "Investing" typically requires a great deal of knowledge and
familiarity  with  one's  assets.  Conversely,  "working"  requires  a  great  deal  of
energy and vigor.

“投资”要求对知识的良好处理和对一个人资产的熟悉。相反的，“工作”要求巨大的体力和精力。

 This is why hunter-gatherers protect their old and why farmers
historically  have  focused  on  having  many  children.  From  the  worker's
perspective,  an  industrial  society  is  closer  to  the  farming  community.

这也就是问什么采集狩猎者包含老人，而农民历史上关注有更多的孩子。从工人的视角上看，工业社会更接近农业社会。

  In  this
case, the crops are people, specifically the products made by people. From the
investor's  perspective,  it's  the  capital  market  that  is  of  primary  focus. 

这种情况下，人就是由人生产的特殊的谷物。从投资者的视角上看，这就是资本市场首要关注的。

 Here
experience and wisdom are more important.
For an investor, the start of financial independence includes a strong vision
of  one  day  creating  a  metaphorical  forest  and  living  harmoniously  with  the
forest. 

在这里，经验和智慧是更重要的。作为一个投资者，财务独立的开始，包含了创造一个象征性的森林，并且和这片森林融洽相处。

It starts by planting seeds. These seeds grow into saplings and the mind
starts connecting the vision to the upcoming reality of a mature forest.

开始是埋下种子。种子长大成树苗，思想开始和视野连接，看到即将到了的成熟的森林。

 When you
live for the future, your present will very much be determined by the actions of
your  past. 

当你为未来生活打算，你的当下很大程度由你过去的行动决定。

 Hence,  you'll  only  live  in  a  forest  if  your  past  self  at  some  point
decided to plant the seeds.

也就是，你只会生活在你过去决定种下的种子，长成的森林里。

Contrast this with living for the present, in which case your future will be
uncertain. 

相反，生活在当下，你的未来就是不确定的。

A person living in the present would very much like to cut down that
forest as soon as possible and turn it into paper. 

生活在当下的人会非常乐意砍倒森林，越快把它变成纸越好。

A future-oriented person would
carefully  try  to  preserve  his  principal  asset,  the  forest,  and  only  cut  when
necessary, living off the trimmings. 

一个面向未来的人会精选包含他原则性的资产，这片森林，只修剪出必要的，生活所需的一点。

He would think of his wealth as the amount
of wood he can get by trimming, not the amount of wood he could get if he cut
the forest down. 

他会认为他的财富是从森林里修剪出的木头，而不是砍倒整片森林的木头。

Unfortunately, so many people see it differently. That is why
they keep working to both cut down existing trees, as well as planting seeds and
cutting down the saplings as soon as they get the chance. 

不幸的是，太多人不这样看。这就是问什么他们持续地砍倒已有的树，同时又在砍倒的地方栽下小树。

They don't see the
freedom that the mature forest offers. The entire focus is on maximum wood
production in the present rather than minimum effort in the future.

他们看不见成熟森林给予的自由。而是关注当下的最大产出，而不是未来的最小化投入。

This  frame  of  mind  is  pervasive.  Retirement is  seen  as  spending  hoarded
savings,  and  survivalists tend  to  focus  on  stocking  up  on  tools  and  supplies.

这种思维模式非常普遍。退休被看作是花掉积蓄，求生清单被认为是储藏一大堆工具和补给品。

Rather than forming an environment which can sustain them, they accumulate
assets  to  survive  in  an  environment  that  isn't  conducive  to  their  living.

不利于能继续供给他们的环境，而是积累一大堆财务，在一个有帮助的环境求生。

Conversely, a hunter-gatherer lives in an environment conducive to living. 

相反的，采集狩猎者生活在有助于生活的环境。

The
traditional hunter-gatherer works 15 hours a week to gather resources from his
environment.  

一个典型的采集狩猎者每周花15小时从他的环境中收集资源。

With  our  level  of  technology  and  understanding,  we  can  gather
resources from our environment more effectively and only work a few hours a
week, or part of the year, or develop enough assets to no longer work at all,
letting others do the work.

随着我们技术和理解的水平的上升，我们能从我们环境中更有效地收集资源，这样，我们每周只需工作几小时，或者每年的部分视角，或者发展足够的财产永远不用工作，让其他人工作。
