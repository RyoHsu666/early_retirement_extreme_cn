An ecosystem has four components, which form a cycle: Abiotic (resources),
producers, consumers, and decomposers. 

生态系统循环里有四个组件：无机物（养料）、生产者、消费者、分解者。

Modern economics only considers two
of  these  relevant:  producers  and  consumers. 

现代的生态系统只考虑了其中的两个：生产者和消费者。

 It  ignores  the  finite103  abiotic
resources and presumes that their only limit is the producers' ability to turn them
into  commodities. 

它忽略了有限的资源，并且假设唯一的限制因素是，生产者能把它们变成商品。

 Similarly,  consumers  and  producers  ignore  decomposition.

相似的，消费者和生产者忽略了分解过程。

Once  our  waste  and  detritus  is  dumped  into  landfills,  lakes,  rivers,  and  the
atmosphere, and is out of sight, it is, for all intents and purposes, out of mind.

废弃物一经倾倒到土地、湖泊、河流、大气层里，它们就消失在视野以外了，并且被主观地忽视了。

Meanwhile,  the  finite  planet  is  running  out  of  its  finite  resources  (duh!)  and
pollution keeps increasing and is starting to bite back. 

与此同时，有限的土地耗尽资源，并且污染还在侵蚀土地。

Typically, the economists
solve  this  problem  by  waving  their  hands  and  mumbling  something  about
substitution  and  human  ingenuity. 

典型地，生态系统通过摆手和低语，解决着人类的聪明才智。

 However,  it's  obvious  that  our  cultural
paradigm is incomplete and that resources and decomposition capacity can no
longer be considered infinite.

然而，很明显，我们目前的文化习惯是和有限资源不相容的，分解容量也不能再认为是无效的了。

Naturally, the economy can't keep growing without killing itself if the cycle
isn't completed.

自然地，当生态圈不能完整循环时，继续增长，它不可能不崩溃。

 If the cycle is not completed, we're either going to run out of
resources or drown in pollution. 

如果循环不完整，我们要么耗尽资源，要么生活在污染里。

If a decision is made to solve this problem, the
size of the economy would be determined by how efficient the cycle is. 

如果想要解决这个问题，必须要考虑整个生态的循环总量和效率。

Given
the enormous size of the human population in relation to the renewable resource
base of  Earth, completing  this  cycle and  preventing leaks  will  be to  the  21st
century  what  the  Cold  War  was  to  the  20th  century.  In  this  book  we're  not
focused  on  the  necessary  policy  decisions,  but  rather  what  the  individual
decisions should be. An economic system has trophic levels like an ecosystem
with  groups  or  socioeconomic  strata  feeding  off  each  other.  In  a  growth
economy, there are workers, organizers of workers, owners of assets, and owners
of land. In a complete ecology, there are abiotics,  producers,  consumers,  and
decomposers.
Humans  are  sufficiently  adaptable  to  execute  any  of  these  roles  in  either
system.  Economic  decision-making  must  be  expanded  to  include  all  these
factors. Until such an understanding is codified into human behavior via law,
religion, and values, something that those who profit from the current setup are
not apt to do anytime soon, individuals need to act as if such a code already
existed, since economic decision-making eventually does catch up to reality. The
economy has many unrecognized inefficiencies--it is, for example, possible for
more  people  to  play  the  role  of  decomposers  (recycling,  upcycling)  and
producers  as  well  as  becoming  less  dependent  on  abiotic  resources.  The
challenge  is  to  do  this  within  the  existing  framework.  Net  savings--lifetime
income  minus  lifetime  expenses--equals  a  person's  contribution  to  society.  It
illustrates how much the person has given versus how much the person has taken
on  an  economic  basis,  as  measured  in  money.  Using  the  saved  money,  it's
possible to acquire productive factors by trading. In a less specialized society,
imagine  having  spent  the  time  building  and  accumulating  tools  and  other
productive  factors  that  make  work  more  productive.  The  same  society  also
allows  for  a  conversion  of  tools  back  into  money  for  spending.  It's  a  more
abstract way of arranging matters than building a shoe-making machine which is
capable of outputting a lifetime of shoes, rather than having it output a pair of
shoes every decade after the previous pair have worn out. "Investing" is simply
the process of putting this idea into practice. An "investor" is thus a person who
lives from his assets. A capitalist is an "investor." A hunter-gatherer, who has a
way of life that has survived for tens of thousands of years, is to a large extent
also an "investor." "Investing" typically requires a great deal of knowledge and
familiarity  with  one's  assets.  Conversely,  "working"  requires  a  great  deal  of
energy and vigor. This is why hunter-gatherers protect their old and why farmers
historically  have  focused  on  having  many  children.  From  the  worker's
perspective,  an  industrial  society  is  closer  to  the  farming  community.  In  this
case, the crops are people, specifically the products made by people. From the
investor's  perspective,  it's  the  capital  market  that  is  of  primary  focus.  Here
experience and wisdom are more important.
For an investor, the start of financial independence includes a strong vision
of  one  day  creating  a  metaphorical  forest  and  living  harmoniously  with  the
forest. It starts by planting seeds. These seeds grow into saplings and the mind
starts connecting the vision to the upcoming reality of a mature forest. When you
live for the future, your present will very much be determined by the actions of
your  past.  Hence,  you'll  only  live  in  a  forest  if  your  past  self  at  some  point
decided to plant the seeds.
Contrast this with living for the present, in which case your future will be
uncertain. A person living in the present would very much like to cut down that
forest as soon as possible and turn it into paper. A future-oriented person would
carefully  try  to  preserve  his  principal  asset,  the  forest,  and  only  cut  when
necessary, living off the trimmings. He would think of his wealth as the amount
of wood he can get by trimming, not the amount of wood he could get if he cut
the forest down. Unfortunately, so many people see it differently. That is why
they keep working to both cut down existing trees, as well as planting seeds and
cutting down the saplings as soon as they get the chance. They don't see the
freedom that the mature forest offers. The entire focus is on maximum wood
production in the present rather than minimum effort in the future.
This  frame  of  mind  is  pervasive.  Retirement is  seen  as  spending  hoarded
savings,  and  survivalists tend  to  focus  on  stocking  up  on  tools  and  supplies.
Rather than forming an environment which can sustain them, they accumulate
assets  to  survive  in  an  environment  that  isn't  conducive  to  their  living.
Conversely, a hunter-gatherer lives in an environment conducive to living. The
traditional hunter-gatherer works 15 hours a week to gather resources from his
environment.  With  our  level  of  technology  and  understanding,  we  can  gather
resources from our environment more effectively and only work a few hours a
week, or part of the year, or develop enough assets to no longer work at all,
letting others do the work
