The  problem  with  most  non-Renaissance  goal  setting  is  that  it  is  either
linear--

大多数非文艺复兴式的目标设定要么是线性的，

that  is,  typically  advancing  along  a  predetermined  career path--

也就是，通常有一个预设的职业轨迹，

or  it  is
separated from life--

要么是和生活分离，

that is, a businessman may have many goals for the business
but few goals for himself. 

也就是，一个商人设定了很多生意目标但没有给他自己设定目标。

Similarly, salary men and working men are likely to
concentrate  on  only  a  single  goal, 

同样的，薪资人和打工人通常只有单一的目标，

 such  as  maintaining  a  certain  grade  point
average,  getting  a  raise,  accumulating  a  certain  amount  of  money,  getting
promoted, providing for a family, etc. 

例如维护一个确定的平均职级，提升，积累一定数量的钱，晋升，供给家庭等等。

If there are multiple goals, they're likely to
be separated by the work-life mantra (see this figure). 

如果有多重目标，他们可能不分割成工作-生活的咒语（参考这张图）。

Here one goal could be to
provide for the family, and the other, unrelated goal could be to reach a more
ideal bodyweight. 

一个目标可以用于供给家庭，其他不相关的目标可以是更理想的体重。

For the Renaissance man, however, the end goal is to blur the
line between work and life rather than a balance between work and life. 

对于文艺复兴人，目标的终点是生活和工作的模糊，而不是生活和工作的平衡。

Consider
that almost any work becomes drudgery if you have to do it all day every day,
whereas scrubbing toilets or filing forms might not be too bad if you only have
to do it 15 minutes a week.

考虑到大多数的你不得不做的工作都变成了苦工，然而每周花15分钟用来刷马桶或者填表格可能不太坏。

Ultimately  all  modules  should  produce  value  in  some  form:  better  health,
new/better  connections  or  skills. 

终极的的模块应提供这样的形势：对健康更好，新的/更好的技能间的连接。

 And  no  module  should  consume  the  value
produced  by  another.  

并且没有模块消耗其他模块的供给。

In  particular,  different  productions  should  never  cancel
each other out, something which is all too common these days. 

特别的，不同的产出不应该取消掉其他的产出，这样事在当前是非常普遍的。

For example, the
invention  of  faster  transport  was  canceled  out  by  increasing  travel  distances,
larger productivity was canceled out by greater waste, etc.

例如，发明更快的交通工具被增加旅行的距离消减了，更高的生产力被更大的浪费消减了。

With each module being self-supported, self-sufficient, internally integrated,
and loosely coupled, with no module dominating the others, modules should be
easily  substitutable,  but  connected  in  a  loose  confederation  of  "independent
entities" aligned in a common goal, so that the sum is greater than the parts.

随着每个模块能够自支持，自满足，内部的集成性和松耦合，没有一个模块能压倒其他，模块能够简单的替换，但是能由一个共同的目标结合成一个“接口独立”的松散联盟，因此总和大于部分。

 In
other words, arrange your life like an orchestra or a sports team, which don't
depend on any single player.

换句话说，像管弦乐队或体育队伍一样组织你的生活，也就是不依赖任何单一的人员。
