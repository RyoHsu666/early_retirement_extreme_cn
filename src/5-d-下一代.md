When a new field is invented, it's not the salary men, the businessmen, or the working  men  who  dominate  it;  it's  the  inventors--the  Renaissance  men. 

A  new field  does  not  need  to  be  commercial,  nor  does  it  need  to  sweep  the  world  or usher in a new era. 

Whether it's raising goats or a family, starting an ecological community  or  an  IT  company,  or  preparing  for  the  end  of  the  world,  the Renaissance man is the one who will get it done. 


For  several  generations  many  people  have  been  preoccupied  with  the mundane  details  of  earning  and  buying  as  an  end  rather  than  a  means. 

They spend their most productive hours and years in a job which they don't really care about,  after  which  they  go  home  exhausted  to  deal  with  spouse,  kids,  dinner, bills,  trying  to  keep  up  with  the  neighbors,  and  languishing  in  front  of  the  TV because they have little energy left. 


New generations have begun to question the wisdom of joining the scheme known  as  the  rat  race. 

Some  have  decided  not  to  fight  for  a  top  spot  in  the corporate  pyramid  scheme,  which  in  the  previous  stage  was  more  akin  to climbing the corporate ladder; instead, they bypass the gatekeepers of traditional career  paths  and  search  for  new  venues  to  populate  so  as  to  avoid  the overcrowded traditional job market. 


The big question is therefore whether to play the games of modern consumer society or whether to start something different and, dare I say more creative? We live  in  a  consumer  society  where  the  focus  is  on  service  and  finance,  due  to  a declining natural resource base. 

We also see the emerging problems of consumer society--stress,  overwork,  inflation,  lack  of  balance,  lack  of  paradigm-shifting innovation, stagnation, and loss of control--both on a personal, and occasionally a  national  scale. 

This  indicates  that  this  figure  is  beginning  to  come  to  a  full circle. 


It's  not  clear  which  direction  the  next  cycle  will  take  humanity--brave  new world, information  revolution and  the discovery of commercial fusion, or peak oil/water, irreversible climate crisis, and the decline and fall of civilization.24 Yet this will all be decided by those who live now; in part by you, and none will be more ideally prepared for a changing world, indeed to change the world, than a Renaissance man.
