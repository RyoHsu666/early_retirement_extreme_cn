When a new field is invented, it's not the salary men, the businessmen, or the working  men  who  dominate  it;  it's  the  inventors--the  Renaissance  men. 
当一个新的领域被发明时，支配它的不是薪资人、生意人或打工人；而是发明家，文艺复兴人。
A  new field  does  not  need  to  be  commercial,  nor  does  it  need  to  sweep  the  world  or usher in a new era. 
一个新的领域不需要商业化，也不需要横扫世界或开创一个新时代。
Whether it's raising goats or a family, starting an ecological community  or  an  IT  company,  or  preparing  for  the  end  of  the  world,  the Renaissance man is the one who will get it done. 
无论是养羊还是养家，创建生态社区或科技公司，还是为世界末日做准备，文艺复兴人都是能够实现这一目标的人。

For  several  generations  many  people  have  been  preoccupied  with  the mundane  details  of  earning  and  buying  as  an  end  rather  than  a  means. 
几代人以来，许多人都把赚钱和买东西作为一种目的而不是一种手段。
They spend their most productive hours and years in a job which they don't really care about,  after  which  they  go  home  exhausted  to  deal  with  spouse,  kids,  dinner, bills,  trying  to  keep  up  with  the  neighbors,  and  languishing  in  front  of  the  TV because they have little energy left. 
他们在一份自己并不在乎的工作上，度过了他们最富有创造力的时光，之后他们回到家，疲惫不堪地处理配偶、孩子、晚餐、账单，努力跟上邻居的步伐，耗尽能量，在电视机前疲惫不堪。

New generations have begun to question the wisdom of joining the scheme known  as  the  rat  race. 
新一代人开始质疑加入这项被称为“老鼠赛跑”的计划是否明智。
Some  have  decided  not  to  fight  for  a  top  spot  in  the corporate  pyramid  scheme,  which  in  the  previous  stage  was  more  akin  to climbing the corporate ladder; instead, they bypass the gatekeepers of traditional career  paths  and  search  for  new  venues  to  populate  so  as  to  avoid  the overcrowded traditional job market. 
有些人决定不在企业金字塔计划中争夺最高职位，而在前一阶段，人们则更热衷攀登企业阶梯；相反，他们绕过传统职业道路的看门人，寻找新的就业场所，以避免过度拥挤的传统就业市场。

The big question is therefore whether to play the games of modern consumer society or whether to start something different and, dare I say more creative? We live  in  a  consumer  society  where  the  focus  is  on  service  and  finance,  due  to  a declining natural resource base. 
因此，最大的问题是，是要玩现代消费社会的游戏，还是要开始一些不同的东西，我可以说是更具创造性的东西吗？我们生活在一个以服务和金融为中心的消费社会，这建立在消耗自然资源基础上。
We also see the emerging problems of consumer society--stress,  overwork,  inflation,  lack  of  balance,  lack  of  paradigm-shifting innovation, stagnation, and loss of control--both on a personal, and occasionally a  national  scale. 
我们还看到消费社会正在出现的问题——压力、过度工作、通货膨胀、缺乏平衡、缺乏范式转换创新、停滞和失控——无论是在个人层面，还是在国家层面。
This  indicates  that  this  figure  is  beginning  to  come  to  a  full circle. 
这表明这张[图]()开始进入了一个完整的循环。

It's  not  clear  which  direction  the  next  cycle  will  take  humanity--brave  new world, information  revolution and  the discovery of commercial fusion, or peak oil/water, irreversible climate crisis, and the decline and fall of civilization.24 
还不清楚下一个周期将把人类带向哪个方向——勇敢的新世界、信息革命和商业融合的发现，或石油/水的峰值、不可逆转的气候危机或是文明的衰退和崩溃。
Yet this will all be decided by those who live now; in part by you, and none will be more ideally prepared for a changing world, indeed to change the world, than a Renaissance man.
然而，这一切都将由现在活着的人来决定；在某种程度上是由你决定的，没有人比文艺复兴人更能为一个不断变化的世界做好理想的准备。
