Most  consumables  and  many  capital  assets  suffer  depreciation  and  lose resale value year after year.

High-quality items, particularly if they involve old technology  that  has  become  canonical--that  is,  it  can't  be  improved--don't  lose value  and  may  even  gain  value,  effectively  functioning  as  an  inflation  hedge.

Some examples include revolvers (but not pistols), woodworking and machining tools, mechanical watches, tube amplifiers, wool coats, knives, fishing reels, etc.

For  example,  a  new  high-quality  tenon  saw  may  cost  $145.

Since  there  is little  difference  functionally  between  a  new  high-quality  saw  and  an  old  high- quality saw, the used price may be $130.

All things being equal, the price after several  years  will  still  be  $130.

If  you  managed  to  fix  it  up--for  instance,  by refurbishing  the  handle  or  sharpening  the  blade--it  may  fetch  more.

If  you  got some rust  spots  on it,  it  may  lose  value.

Subtracting the  purchasing  price from the  sales  price  should  come  to  a  small  amount.

It's  interesting  to  note  that  this amount  is  comparable  to  or  smaller  than  the  price  of  a  cheap  new  $20  saw, which  will  only  fetch  $1  if  you  sell  it.

This  is  also  more  environmentally  and financially  sustainable:  Sustainability  comes  from  lifetime  ownership--not necessarily  by  the  same  person--of  one  quality  item  instead  of  10  disposable items.

Doing some research and plotting prices as a function of product age creates a depreciation scatter plot.

For each year there will be a range of prices reflecting the  different  conditions.

If  the  curve  is  trending  downwards,  the  fixer-upper strategy is to buy something in poor condition, fix it up and sell it later.

This will make the holding cost zero.

This way you can own expensive items, like boats or cars, for almost no cost.

In  terms  of  financial  considerations,  the  money  which  is  now  sitting  in  an asset that  is unproductive has opportunity  costs.

If  your  rate  of  return  is  6%,  a $50,000 boat would cost you $3,000 annually, which you could have made had the money been invested.

On the other hand, perhaps you were holding cash at 0.5%.

In this case,  your  cost  is  only  $250.

If you  offer the  boat for  chartering, you may even make money.
