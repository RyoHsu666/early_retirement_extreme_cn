Most  consumables  and  many  capital  assets  suffer  depreciation  and  lose resale value year after year.
大多数消耗品和许多资本资产遭受折旧，年复一年地失去转售价值。
High-quality items, particularly if they involve old technology  that  has  become  canonical--that  is,  it  can't  be  improved--don't  lose value  and  may  even  gain  value,  effectively  functioning  as  an  inflation  hedge.
高质量的商品，尤其是当它们涉及已成为标准的旧技术时——也就是说，它无法改进——就不会贬值，甚至可能增值，有效地起到了通胀对冲的作用。
Some examples include revolvers (but not pistols), woodworking and machining tools, mechanical watches, tube amplifiers, wool coats, knives, fishing reels, etc.
一些例子包括左轮手枪（但不是手枪）、木工和机械加工工具、机械手表、扬声器、羊毛外套、刀具、钓鱼卷轴等。

For  example,  a  new  high-quality  tenon  saw  may  cost  $145.
例如，一个新的高质量榫锯可能需要145美元。
Since  there  is little  difference  functionally  between  a  new  high-quality  saw  and  an  old  high- quality saw, the used price may be $130.
由于新的高质量锯子和旧的高质量锯子在功能上几乎没有区别，所以旧锯子的价格可能是130美元。
All things being equal, the price after several  years  will  still  be  $130.
在所有条件相同的情况下，几年后的价格仍然是130美元。
If  you  managed  to  fix  it  up--for  instance,  by refurbishing  the  handle  or  sharpening  the  blade--it  may  fetch  more.
如果你设法修缮——例如，通过翻新手柄或磨快锯片——它可能会卖更多。
If  you  got some rust  spots  on it,  it  may  lose  value.
如果上面有锈斑，它可能会贬值。
Subtracting the  purchasing  price from the  sales  price  should  come  to  a  small  amount.
从销售价格中减去购买价格应该是一个小数目。
It's  interesting  to  note  that  this amount  is  comparable  to  or  smaller  than  the  price  of  a  cheap  new  $20  saw, which  will  only  fetch  $1  if  you  sell  it.
值得注意的是，这个价格相当于或低于一把20美元的廉价新锯子的价格，如果你卖掉它，它只能卖1美元。
This  is  also  more  environmentally  and financially  sustainable:  Sustainability  comes  from  lifetime  ownership--not necessarily  by  the  same  person--of  one  quality  item  instead  of  10  disposable items.
这在环境和财务上也更具可持续性：可持续性来自终身拥有——不一定由同一个人拥有——一件优质物品，而不是十件一次性物品。

Doing some research and plotting prices as a function of product age creates a depreciation scatter plot.
做一些研究并绘制价格和使用年限的函数，可以绘制一个折旧散点图。
For each year there will be a range of prices reflecting the  different  conditions.
每年都会有一系列反映不同情况的价格。
If  the  curve  is  trending  downwards,  the  fixer-upper strategy is to buy something in poor condition, fix it up and sell it later.
如果曲线呈下降趋势，策略是购买状况不佳的产品，修复后再出售。
This will make the holding cost zero.
这将使持有成本为零。
This way you can own expensive items, like boats or cars, for almost no cost.
这样你就可以拥有昂贵的物品，比如船只或汽车，几乎不需要任何费用。

In  terms  of  financial  considerations,  the  money  which  is  now  sitting  in  an asset that  is unproductive has opportunity  costs.
从财务角度考虑，目前存放在非生产性资产中的资金具有机会成本。
If  your  rate  of  return  is  6%,  a $50,000 boat would cost you $3,000 annually, which you could have made had the money been invested.
如果你的回报率是6%，一艘价值5万美元的船每年将花费你3000美元，如果这笔钱用于投资的话，你本可以赚到这笔钱。
On the other hand, perhaps you were holding cash at 0.5%.
另一方面，你可能持有现金的回报率是0.5%。
In this case,  your  cost  is  only  $250.
在这种情况下，成本仅为250美元。
If you  offer the  boat for  chartering, you may even make money.
如果你愿意租船，你甚至可以赚钱。
