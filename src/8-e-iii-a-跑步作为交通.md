When I first came to the US in 2004, someone asked me if I rode bicycles. 

I replied in the affirmative, and then I was asked whether I liked to ride for fun. 

"For fun?" You see, in the US people mainly ride bikes recreationally, whereas in Europe people mainly ride bikes as a form of transportation. 

This partially goes to show how deeply ingrained the association of certain modes of transportation are with certain activities. 

Further, in the US walking is something you do inside the  mall,  and  in  Europe  walking  is  something  you  do  to  get  to  the  bus  stop. 

However, when it comes to running, both Europe and the US are similar in that running is a recreational activity. 

However, for the fit person who wouldn't break a  sweat  from  jogging  a  couple  of  miles,  running  could  easily  be  a  way  to  get from A to B which is as simple as walking--you only need a pair of shoes--but 2- 3  times  faster. 

For  short  distances  up  to  three  miles,  it's  almost  as  fast  as  slow cycling because it takes a few minutes on each end to get the bike out and ready. 

It's possible to run with small loads using a backpack. 

If the backpack is loaded with  more  than  a  dozen pounds,  however,  normal  running becomes  destructive to the knees. 

Instead, run in a gliding fashion, keeping the knees close together and always one foot on the ground. 


It would thus be possible to literally run small errands, like picking up small items  from  the  supermarket,  and  anyone  who  does  this  on  a  regular  basis  is bound  to  end  up  with  sustained  low-intensity  endurance  and  a  resting  pulse lower than 50 beats per minute. 


If  you  managed  to  arrange  your  residence  to  be  less  than  three  miles  from anything, you wouldn't even need a bicycle. 

In that case, I would walk to work, which would take 60 minutes that could be used for meditation, brainstorming or calculating your passive income from your savings in as many ways as you can think  of,  and  then  run  home,  which  would  take  about  20  minutes. 

When shopping, I'd run with an empty backpack and then walk a full backpack home. 

It is a more minimalist approach than the bicycle option.
