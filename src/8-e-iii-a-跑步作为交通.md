When I first came to the US in 2004, someone asked me if I rode bicycles. 
2004年我第一次来到美国时，有人问我是否骑自行车。
I replied in the affirmative, and then I was asked whether I liked to ride for fun. 
我的回答是肯定的，然后有人问我是否喜欢骑车消遣。
"For fun?" You see, in the US people mainly ride bikes recreationally, whereas in Europe people mainly ride bikes as a form of transportation. 
“为了好玩？”你看，在美国，人们主要以休闲方式骑自行车，而在欧洲，人们主要以骑自行车作为一种交通工具。
This partially goes to show how deeply ingrained the association of certain modes of transportation are with certain activities. 
这在一定程度上说明了某些交通方式与某些活动之间的联系是多么根深蒂固。
Further, in the US walking is something you do inside the  mall,  and  in  Europe  walking  is  something  you  do  to  get  to  the  bus  stop. 
此外，在美国，步行是你在商场里做的事情，而在欧洲，步行是你去公交车站做的事情。
However, when it comes to running, both Europe and the US are similar in that running is a recreational activity. 
然而，说到跑步，欧洲和美国的相似之处在于跑步是一种娱乐活动。
However, for the fit person who wouldn't break a  sweat  from  jogging  a  couple  of  miles,  running  could  easily  be  a  way  to  get from A to B which is as simple as walking--you only need a pair of shoes--but 2- 3  times  faster. 
然而，对于那些不会因为慢跑几公里而流汗的健康人来说，跑步很容易成为从A到B的一种方式，就像走路一样简单——你只需要一双鞋——但速度要快2-3倍。
For  short  distances  up  to  three  miles,  it's  almost  as  fast  as  slow cycling because it takes a few minutes on each end to get the bike out and ready. 
对于五公里的短距离，它几乎和慢速自行车一样快，因为每一端都需要几分钟的时间来准备自行车。
It's possible to run with small loads using a backpack. 
使用背包可以小负荷跑步。
If the backpack is loaded with  more  than  a  dozen pounds,  however,  normal  running becomes  destructive to the knees. 
然而，如果背包的重量超过5公斤，那么正常跑步会对膝盖造成破坏。
Instead, run in a gliding fashion, keeping the knees close together and always one foot on the ground. 
相反，以滑行的方式跑步，膝盖并拢，一只脚始终放在地面上。

It would thus be possible to literally run small errands, like picking up small items  from  the  supermarket,  and  anyone  who  does  this  on  a  regular  basis  is bound  to  end  up  with  sustained  low-intensity  endurance  and  a  resting  pulse lower than 50 beats per minute. 
因此，人们可以做一些琐碎的事情，比如从超市买一些小东西，而任何经常这样做的人最终都会有持续的低强度耐力，和低于每分钟50次的休息脉搏。

If  you  managed  to  arrange  your  residence  to  be  less  than  three  miles  from anything, you wouldn't even need a bicycle. 
如果你能把住所安排在离任何地方不到五公里的地方，你甚至不需要自行车。
In that case, I would walk to work, which would take 60 minutes that could be used for meditation, brainstorming or calculating your passive income from your savings in as many ways as you can think  of,  and  then  run  home,  which  would  take  about  20  minutes. 
在这种情况下，我会步行去上班，这需要60分钟，可以用来冥想、头脑风暴，或者用你能想到的各种方式计算你的被动储蓄收入，然后跑回家，大约需要20分钟。
When shopping, I'd run with an empty backpack and then walk a full backpack home. 
购物时，我会背着一个空背包跑步，然后背着一个满背包步行回家。
It is a more minimalist approach than the bicycle option.
这是一个比自行车选项更简约的方法。
