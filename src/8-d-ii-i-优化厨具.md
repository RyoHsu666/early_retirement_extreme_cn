In general, simple meals are easier to cook. 
一般来说，简单的饭菜更容易烹饪。
This means less need for unusual ingredients or utensils, less time spent preparing, and less time cleaning up. 
这意味着对不寻常的食材或餐具的需求减少，准备时间减少，清理时间减少。
The simplest meal is the one-pot meal. 
最简单的一餐是一锅烩。
You will find many ideas for one-pot meals in cookbooks focusing on slow cookers. 
你会在烹饪书中找到许多关于慢炖的一锅烩的想法。
These can be eaten directly out of the pot. 
这些可以直接用锅吃。
Many  cultures  do  this. 
许多文化都这样做。
A  better  choice  than  the  slow  cooker  is  the  traditional slow  cooking  setup:  the  hay  box.94  Instead  of  an  actual  hay  box,  put  the  pot under the blankets of the bed. 
比慢炖锅更好的选择是传统的慢煮设置：干草箱。这不是一个真正的干草箱，而是把罐子放在床的毯子下面。
This also heats up the bed. 
这也能暖床。
Alternatively, use an old  sleeping  bag,  or  a  cardboard  box  inside  a  bigger  cardboard  box  with newspaper  shreddings  in  between. 
或者，使用一个旧睡袋，或者在一个较大的纸箱里放一个纸箱，中间夹着报纸碎纸。
The  ideal  pot  for  this  is  a  pressure  cooker because it naturally seals, but take the rubber gasket off or use an old one when in  slow-cooking  mode  to  keep  it  from  wearing  out. 
最理想的锅是压力锅，因为它可以自然密封，但在慢速烹饪模式下，可以取下橡胶垫圈或使用旧的垫圈，以防磨损。
Pressure  cooking  also radically cuts down on time and fuel use as well as making some dishes much easier. 
压力烹饪也大大减少了时间和燃料的使用，并使一些菜肴更容易。
For  instance,  I  have  never  burned  any  of  my  rice  in  a  pressure  cooker because  the  heat  comes  from  the  steam  pressure  rather  than  from  the  bottom, which it does in a conventional boil. 
例如，我从来不在高压锅里烧饭，因为热量来自蒸汽压力，而不是传统煮沸时的底部。

Specific  diets  also  influence  the  choice  of  utensils. 
特定的饮食也会影响炊具的选择。
For  example,  someone choosing to eat raw food only, a diet which can fulfill all dietary requirements, wouldn't need a stove but would need a dehydrator (it's easy to build your own), a  blender  (somewhat  trickier),  and  probably  a  juicer  instead. 
例如，有人选择只吃生的食物，一种可以满足所有饮食要求的饮食，不需要炉子，但需要脱水机（你自己做很容易）、搅拌机（有点棘手），可能还需要榨汁机。
Such  a  person's kitchen  would  look  quite  different  from  the  norm. 
这样一个人的厨房看起来会与普通厨房大不相同。
Similarly,  someone  living close to the supermarket (see How to find shelter) and not  storing  more  than a day's worth of perishables could eliminate the need for a refrigerator. 
类似地，住在超市附近（看看[如何找到庇护所]()）且储存的易腐物品不超过一天的人可能不需要冰箱。
After all, the refrigerator is a recent invention. 
毕竟，冰箱是最近才发明的。
The refrigerator could also be eliminated by changing  ingredients. 
冰箱也可以通过改变原料来消除。
Shopping  outside  the  refrigerated  section  also  means avoiding  meat  and  dairy  products. 
在冷藏区外购物也意味着避免肉类和乳制品。
Many  fruits,  vegetables,  and  tubers  store without  refrigeration  for  weeks  or  even  months:  Potatoes,  sweet  potatoes, cabbage,  onions,  garlic,  carrots,  winter  squash,  turnips,  apples,  oranges,  limes and lemons. 
许多水果、蔬菜和块茎在没有冷藏的情况下储存数周甚至数月：土豆、红薯、卷心菜、洋葱、大蒜、胡萝卜、冬瓜、芜菁、苹果、橙子、酸橙和柠檬。
Others store for days: Bananas, lettuce, tomatoes, green beans, and melons. 
还有一些可以储存数天：香蕉、莴苣、西红柿、青豆和瓜类。
Books on boat provisioning are a good source of this information, as are old cookbooks. 
关于船上供应的书籍是这些信息的一个很好的来源，就像古老的烹饪书一样。
This doesn't require a complete elimination of meat or ice cream, etc.;  it  just  means  only  buying  what  will  be  eaten  that  day. 
这不是完全消除肉类或冰淇淋等。而是只买当天要吃的东西。
All  things  being equal, not having a refrigerator will likely make one's diet healthier. 
在所有条件相同的情况下，没有冰箱可能会使一个人的饮食更健康。
Of course, not  having  a  refrigerator  doesn't  mean  not  having  a  freezer. 
当然，没有冰箱并不意味着没有冷冻器。
When  selecting utensils,  keep  Appropriate  response  and  Which  things  should  I  own?  in  mind. 
在选择厨具时，记住[恰当的反应]()和[我应该持有哪些东西？]()
The modern kitchen is full of specialized junk that only serves a single function. 
现代厨房里堆满了只提供单一功能的专用垃圾。
Avoid this! For example, instead of putting your spoon or ladle on a spoon rest, put  in  on  a  (try  to  follow  this)  plate  (see  Building blocks). 
避开它们！例如，不要把你的勺子或勺子放在勺子架上，而是放在盘子（试试这个）上（参见[建造模块]()）。
Instead  of  cooking rice  and  eggs  in  dedicated  rice  and  egg  cookers,  use  a  pot. 
不要用专用的电饭煲和鸡蛋煲煮大米和鸡蛋，用锅。
Instead  of  toasting bread in a toaster, use a cast iron pan with a cast iron lid.95 Yes it works. 
不要在烤面包机里烤面包，而是用铸铁锅盖。是的，能用。
Commit to a single knife. 
只用一把刀。
For most people, this is a short chef's knife, although if you're a vegetarian, a serrated utility/tomato knife is perhaps better. 
对大多数人来说，这是一把短厨刀，不过如果你是素食者，锯齿刀/番茄刀可能更好。
I've had the same $5 tomato knife for over 14 years now--best knife ever.
14年来，我一直用着一把5美元的番茄刀——这是有史以来最好的刀。
