Even  though  things  are  changing,  much  modern  strength  training  has  been influenced  by  bodybuilding. 
尽管情况正在发生变化，但许多现代力量训练都受到健美运动的影响。
Bodybuilding  is  primarily  concerned  with developing  a  certain  look  based  on  bulk,  symmetry,  and  definition. 
健美运动主要关注的是根据体型、对称性和定义发展出某种外观。
This  may explain  why  most  women  stay  away  from  any  dumbbell  that  is  not  ultralight-- usually  they  are  color-coded  pink--although  lifting  heavier  weights  could  do wonders  for  preventing  bone  loss--a  solution  currently  sold  in  pill  form--and increasing everyday capabilities. 
这或许可以解释为什么大多数女性远离任何不是超轻的哑铃——通常是粉色的——尽管举重可以神奇地防止骨质流失——目前以药片形式出售的一种解决方案——并提高日常能力。
Since "manly" bulk is currently fashionable,83 guys have no such concerns, and therefore a lot of work goes toward increasing muscle  tissue  primarily  on  the  biceps,  chest,  and  quadriceps  to  manipulate  the body  into  a  certain  look. 
由于“男子气概”身材目前很流行，男性没有这种顾虑，因此大量工作主要是增加二头肌、胸部和股四头肌上的肌肉组织，以将身体操纵成特定的样子。
However,  much  of  this  work  is  directed  towards  the illusion  of  real  strength,84  and  not  as  much  real  world  strength  as  the  look suggests.85 This is similar to how driving a luxury car these days mostly means being able to put one's mark on a lease or a car loan, whereas it used to indicate a measure of wealth since only the really wealthy would be able to pay cash for a luxury vehicle.
然而，这项工作的大部分都是针对真实力量的幻觉，而不是像外观所显示的那么多真实世界的力量。这与如今驾驶豪华汽车的方式类似，主要是指能够在租赁或汽车贷款上留下自己的印记，而它过去用来表示财富的衡量标准，因为只有真正富有的人才能够支付现金购买豪华汽车。
