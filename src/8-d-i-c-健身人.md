Even  though  things  are  changing,  much  modern  strength  training  has  been influenced  by  bodybuilding. 

 Bodybuilding  is  primarily  concerned  with developing  a  certain  look  based  on  bulk,  symmetry,  and  definition. 

 This  may explain  why  most  women  stay  away  from  any  dumbbell  that  is  not  ultralight-- usually  they  are  color-coded  pink--although  lifting  heavier  weights  could  do wonders  for  preventing  bone  loss--a  solution  currently  sold  in  pill  form--and increasing everyday capabilities. 

Since "manly" bulk is currently fashionable,83 guys have no such concerns, and therefore a lot of work goes toward increasing muscle  tissue  primarily  on  the  biceps,  chest,  and  quadriceps  to  manipulate  the body  into  a  certain  look. 

 However,  much  of  this  work  is  directed  towards  the illusion  of  real  strength,84  and  not  as  much  real  world  strength  as  the  look suggests.85 This is similar to how driving a luxury car these days mostly means being able to put one's mark on a lease or a car loan, whereas it used to indicate a measure of wealth since only the really wealthy would be able to pay cash for a luxury vehicle.
