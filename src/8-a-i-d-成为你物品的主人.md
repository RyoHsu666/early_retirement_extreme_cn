I prefer things whose operation can be understood by looking at them. 
我更喜欢那些可以通过观察来理解操作的东西。
When this is not possible, like with electronics (unless you're an electrical engineer, or have the equivalent knowledge, for example, by becoming competent in amateur radio),  I  prefer  things  with  replaceable  components. 
如果这是不可能的，比如电子产品（除非你是电气工程师，或者具备同等的知识，例如，通过精通业余无线电），我更喜欢有可更换组件的产品。
If  one  part  fails,  it  can  be replaced to preserve the integrity of the system. 
如果一个部件出现故障，可以更换它以保持系统的完整性。
Replacing parts corresponds to the  technician  level. 
更换零件与技师级别相对应。
Anyone  can  replace parts. 
任何人都可以更换零件。
The  mechanic  level  is  knowing which part to replace without trying to replace parts at random until it works. 
技工级别是知道要更换哪个零件，而不是随意更换零件直到它工作。
To truly master your  stuff,  it's  worthwhile  to  try  to  build  some  of it  yourself. 
要真正掌握你的东西，你有必要自己动手做一些。
This doesn't  mean  you  should  build  your  own  TV,  but  you  could  build  your  own composting system or furniture. 
这并不意味着你应该建造自己的电视，但你可以建造自己的堆肥系统或家具。
Later you can build your own radio. 
以后你可以建造自己的收音机。
There is a great  deal  of  satisfaction  in  doing  this. 
这样做有很大的满足感。
Furthermore,  disposal  becomes  easier because  knowing  how  to  put  things  together  typically  means  knowing  how  to take  them  apart. 
此外，处置变得更容易，因为知道如何把东西拼在一起，通常意味着知道如何把它们拆开。
It  also  means  that  it's  easier  to  select,  tweak,  and  even  create designs that are more appropriate for a particular purpose. 
这也意味着更容易选择、调整甚至创建更适合特定用途的设计。

In general, I only trust things as far as I can throw them, but that's just me. 
一般来说，我只相信我能扔的东西，但那只是对我来说的。
More importantly, I don't trust things I can't see, like wall conduits. 
更重要的是，我不相信我看不见的东西，比如墙上的导管。
In general, I don't trust things that have been "abstracted" away behind a clever user interface. 
总的来说，我不相信那些被巧妙的用户界面“抽象”掉的东西。
What  this  does  is  merely  to  insert  another  layer  of  experts  between  the  things and the users, allowing the latter to become "lusers." 
这仅仅是在事物和用户之间插入另一层专家，让后者成为“愚蠢的用户（Loser-users）”

There are two kinds of people: 
有两种人：
1. If  something  breaks,  they  call  a  repair  guy  or  throw  it  out  and  buy something new. 
1.如果有东西坏了，他们会打电话给修理工，或者把它扔出去买新的。
2. If something breaks, they are the repair guy and fix it. If you're the latter type, you're the master of your stuff.
2.如果有东西坏了，他们是修理工并修理它。如果你是后一种类型，你就是你的东西的主人。
