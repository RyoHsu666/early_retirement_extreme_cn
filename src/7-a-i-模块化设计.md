Consider the cash flow of a salary man who puts effort into a job that yields
a wage, which is then spent on stuff that is used or consumed in an endless cycle.
This figure shows how the dependencies look in greater detail and in extreme
conditions this can be a literal depiction, where the boxes are buildings and the
arrows  correspond  to  driving a  car  between  the  boxes.  There's  a  box  for  the
home, a box for the job, where the consumer drives to get money, and boxes for
stores, where he drives to exchange the money from his job for entertainment or
stuff which he drives back to his home.

![figure1](../img/7-a-i-fig1.png)

Consumer culture shows a modular structure where problems are solved
by driving to different stores to buy parts of the solution. This activity is
made possible by driving to a job and exchanging time for money.
This figure shows a tight coupling between the consumer, the job, and the
stores, respectively. Here the stores should be thought of broadly as shops, gyms,
restaurants,  dentists,  plumbers,  etc.  If  the  coupling  to  the  job  is  severed,  the
advanced consumer with good credit, savings, or insurance can draw on those,
but he still needs to go to stores for his needs, since everything requires external
interaction in the form of regular trips to stores--"I'm going to the store, need
anything?"
This  is  the  consequence  of  specialization.  The  solutions  to  his  problems,
except the very specialized problem detailed in his job description, have been
outsourced  to  the  marketplace  and  personal  competence  has  been  lost  or
replaced with information on "where to find good deals." Eventually he comes to
depend strongly on this marketplace and hence on his continued employment.

The individual consumers depend as strongly on an aggregate of stores as the
stores depend on the aggregate of consumers. This explains advertising and the
insistence for expert solutions, at least as far as the experts are concerned, for
they need to earn money at their jobs too.
This is outsourcing taken to its logical extreme. Many believe that extreme
outsourcing such as hiring assistants to write personal letters, walk their dog, and
maybe talk to their spouses, is the way to go, counting on lower offshore living
costs  to  maintain  their  comparative  advantage,  or  even  common  outsourcing
such as buying cake mixes, eating out, or having a plumber fix a clogged pipe.
There  are  three  reasons  for  this  line  of  thinking.  The  first  is  misinformation.
Consumers have become convinced that experts are needed for anything but the
simplest task. The second is lack of personal skills. Knowing how to provide
basic needs, like householding skills or how to stay happy, can be tremendously
valuable.  They  can  often  be  had  very  inexpensively  compared  to  what  the
market offers. For instance, imagine the value of a support network of family
and friends, or meaningful, unstressful work, compared to the hourly rate of a
psychotherapist or stress-relieving prescription drugs. Or that preprocessed food,
which only needs to be heated, takes about 15 minutes of salary work to pay for,
which is comparable to the time it takes to cook a similar meal from scratch. The
third is lack of choices. When the market mainly offers full-time jobs and the
culture expects you to spend the rest of your time shopping and watching TV, it
leaves little time for anything else.
For  individuals,  outsourcing  and  comparative  advantage  can't  remain
advantageous  in  practice  if  taken  to  extremes.  Yet  in  many  ways  it  has  been
taken too far already when people spend eight hours a day for 30 years to buy
electric can openers and marble towers.The solution is to reverse the outsourcing
of ordinary life skills and gradually insource skills that were previously acquired
in the marketplace to
become less dependent on a single source of income.
become less dependent on a multitude of store services.
This is both simple as well as tremendously challenging, because it requires
a different kind of thinking. To get started, make a list of services and things
acquired in the marketplace (see Building blocks for how to get a better idea of
how to look for them) and start learning them on a need-to-know basis (see The
Renaissance education). Here is a short list41 of suggestions:

1.  Hair cutting. If necessary change your hairstyle into something you can do.

1. 理发。如果可能，把发行变成你能处理的样子。

Be flexible!

变灵活！

2.  Mending clothes and darning socks.

2. 补衣服和补袜子。

3.  Cooking, preferably from scratch. Heating something in the microwave or
mixing powder with water doesn't count. Again, if necessary, change your
diet.

3. 做饭，最好从基础开始。用微波炉加热或者沏粉末不算。另外，如果有必要，更改你的食谱。

4.  Buying something used instead of new or swapping something. There are
now many websites to facilitate this.

4. 买些二手的东西或者交换一些东西。有特别多的网站来做这个。

5.  Getting somewhere without a car. Use public transportation, commute by
bicycle or try walking a few blocks to the grocery.

5. 不用车到一些地方。使用公共交通，骑自行车或者走路去商店。


6.  Borrowing a book from the library. It's amazing how many people do not
take advantage of this free resource.

6. 从图书馆借书。令人惊讶的是太多人不利用这一免费的资源。

7.  Planting a garden of edible vegetables. Start with spices. Move onto high-
cost/low-effort plants like tomatoes (not potatoes). Look into permaculture
and intensive gardening.

7. 在花园种些可以吃的蔬菜。从调味蔬菜开始。转移到像土豆（不是番茄）这样高回报低投入的植物。研究永久性和集中式的菜园。

8.  Making  simple  nontoxic  household  agents  from  scratch,  like  laundry
detergent, toothpaste, insect killer, window cleaner, or beer.

8. 从头制作一套无害的居家设施，像清洗液，牙膏，杀虫剂，玻璃清洁剂或者啤酒。


9.  Bicycle,  motorcycle,  or  car  maintenance.  At  least  start  by  washing  it
yourself. Move on to fixing flats, cleaning, changing oil, and lubricating
parts. Graduate to disassembling the drive train and engine.

9. 自行车，摩托车，或者汽车的维护。只是从自己洗车开始。移动到修外观，清洁，换机油，更换配件。进阶到拆解驱动装置和引擎。

A very common and very good piece of career advice is not to work to earn
money but to work to learn new skills, gain new connections, and create new
opportunities. Similarly, life advice like the above should not exclusively be for
the purpose of saving money--although it'll come in handy later in Important
financial  ratios--but  to  build  social  cohesion  and  connections  and  learn  and
exercise skills that can later create opportunities. This way, saving money won't
be  seen  as  consumer  deprivation  but  as  producer  manifestation;  you're  now
making something rather than buying it. In my opinion, that makes you a more
interesting person.
Another very common--and in my opinion very bad--piece of advice, at least
for the purposes of attaining success as a Renaissance man is to pick and focus
exclusively on one thing, say hair cutting. This may be fine if you need to make
a career out of it, but if you only need to provide for yourself and possibly a few
friends  there's  no  need  to  specialize  and  develop  all  skills  sufficient  to  be
marketable; just focus on your own hair.
However, without changing one's frame of mind from that of a consumer,
solving  daily  problems  by  learning  a  bunch  of  new  things  and  doing  them
yourself  runs  the  risk  of  turning  into  a  multitude  of  hobbies  (see  here),  as
supplies  are  ordered  from  stores,  clubs  are  joined,  or  projects  become  overly

ambitious,  at  least  in  terms  of  acquiring  the  tools  and  supplies.  This  could
therefore  easily  end  up  strengthening  the  dependencies  of  this  figure,  first
running out to stores to buy supplies and then running back to work to pay for
them, leaving little time and room for the project, which eventually moves out to
the garage with the rest of the stuff.
Therefore,  a  requirement  is  to  make  each  project  self-supported.  To
understand  what  this  means,  divide  the  projects  into  three  groups  (and
everything in between)

Projects that cost money 

花钱的项目

Projects  with  start-up  costs  and  regular  fixed  costs  (see  Depreciation
schedules). 

项目有初创花费和固定支出（参考）。

You need to buy equipment and pay subscription fees or replace
equipment that wears out on a regular basis. Many sports fall under this
category.

你需要购买设备和付订阅费用或者在固定周期替换损耗的设备。很多在运动都可以落在这个条目下。

Projects that are "free" 

“免费的”项目

Projects  with  few  start-up  costs,  no  fixed  costs,  and  no  cash  flow,  but
possibly network connections of learning skills or providing some value.
These projects are free.

项目需要极少的启动资金，没有固定支出，没有现金流，但是可能是学习新技能和提供其他简直的网络连接。这些项目是免费的。

 This can include using things you already have,
such as a computer and an Internet connection.

这可以是使用你已经拥有的事物，例如计算机和网络连接。

Projects that earn money 

赚钱的项目

Projects that are saving you money or--even better--making you money; 

帮你省钱的项目——或更好——帮你赚钱；

not
as in a hopeful future, but now. This could include learning how to cook,
fixing  computers,  mowing  people's  lawns  (for  the  exercise),  babysitting,
etc

不只是在有希望的未来，而是现在。这包括了学习如何烹调，修电脑，帮人剪草坪（用于练习），看孩子等等。


It's of primary importance that a project produces value, even if that value
isn't money, and doesn't destroy value.

最主要的是这些项目产生价值，尽管这些价值不是钱，也不损害它的价值。

Money leaving your pocket is a big warning sign that your activities fall into
the first category.

当你的钱从你的口袋里流走的时候就是一个警示信号，你的活动都掉进了第一个分类。

 These should be avoided as much as possible and replaced
with or modified into activities that are "free" but provide the opportunity to
learn,  meet  new  people,  and  possibly  earn  money  eventually.  

这是需要尽可能避免的并且替换或者修改为“免费”的活动，但能提供学习的计划，遇到新的人，或者偶尔有赚钱的可能。

It's  often  quite
possible to find a direct, yet free, replacement for a cash-negative activity.

找些直接免费的活动来代替负现金流的活动是非常可能的。

 For
instance, rather than going to the movies, you can borrow the DVD from the
library or a friend about six months later if you just change your perspective.

例如，通过改变你的观点，你可以六个月以后从图书馆或者朋友那里借DVD，而不是去电影院。

Don't get too ambitious about making money right away. 

不用太急切的想立刻就赚钱。

Serendipity plays a
larger role in the long term. 


For example, I replaced my fascination with buying
computer  hardware  (expensive  money  sink)  with  learning  about  the  *nix
operating system (free) and eventually ended up as the system administrator of
the department I was working in simply because I was the one who knew the
most when the previous admin left. 


Later I turned the knowledge of emacs and
LaTeX from writing scientific articles into a freelancing job as a copy editor,
which  covered  all  my  expenses  working  approximately  30  minutes  a  day  on
average.  Blogging  was  another  activity  that  started  as  a  constructive  way  of
channeling  my  writing  and  eventually  turned  into  this  book,  which  I  typeset
myself using what I learned as a copy editor. My interest in economics grew out
of my interest in geopolitics, and eventually turned into an interest in investing,
that I combined with my savings, which came from my interest in not spending
money by doing more things myself, and so I was able to devise a custom-made
portfolio that suited my particular investing temperament.
Over time, this approach automatically develops several diversified streams
of cash, as well as many more means to save money and keep that cash. Yet,
cash  flow  is  not  the  only  measure  of  independence.  Some  develop  a  social
network so large that they can travel anywhere with little cost (look into courier
services and couch surfing), and others develop such a wide set of skills along
with an ability to sell those skills that they can work for room and board as well
as a small stipend.
Conversely, it may be that an activity needs certain other connections. For
example, using the company gym for free requires working for the company. In
fact, companies often attempt to strengthen their employees' dependence on the
company by providing "benefits" like health care, retirement plans,  and  other
perks which can be thought of as golden handcuffs. This must be kept in mind
when  resolving  dependencies,  especially  connections  to  things  outside  your
immediate control.
The optimal solution in terms of dependencies and connections is shown in
this figure. Here each project is modularized and acts as a holon. This means that
the connections within the project are strong, whereas the connections between a
project  and  the  external  world  (other  projects)  are  weak.  Consequently,  any
given project doesn't depend very much on other projects, and vice versa. They
are also self-supporting and able to contribute to each other without depending
on each other. It is resilient, much like the Internet is resilient by design, as it can
still  function  even  when  individual  servers  are  down,  as  no  single  server  is
critical. Now, can you say the same thing about your life with regards to your
job? Or your car?
