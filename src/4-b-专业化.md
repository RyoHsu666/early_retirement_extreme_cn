Our educational system and our business leaders all advise us to "become a specialist." The reason is that while generalized skills are very beneficial, they don't fit well into the existing system. 
我们的教育系统和商业领袖都建议我们“成为专家”。 原因是，虽然通用技能非常有益，但它们并不适合现有系统。

The existing system requires specialists--cogs that fit into a system that has already been built. 
现有系统需要专家——构建已有系统的齿轮。

Specialist knowledge is much  cheaper  to  acquire  for  mass  production  purposes  than  is  generalized knowledge. 
为大规模生产目的而获得的专业知识，比一般知识便宜得多。

Imagine all the skills one would need to acquire to build a car from raw minerals that were dug out of the ground. 
想象一下，用从地下挖出的原始矿物，到制造汽车所需的所有技能。

It would take a lifetime to acquire sufficient skills to make a single car, after which one would be too old to make more. 
制造一辆汽车需要一生的时间，才能获得足够的技能，之后就太老了，无法制造更多的汽车。

If, instead, several people learn just one simple skill and are organized into an assembly line, the reduced time spent on learning allows them to produce much  more. 
相反，如果几个人只学习一项简单的技能，并组织成一条装配线，那么花在学习上的时间会减少，他们就能生产更多。

 Given  the  limitations  of  human  intelligence  and  lifespan, specialization is the only way to rapidly produce sophisticated products.
鉴于人类智力和寿命的限制，专业化是快速生产复杂产品的唯一途径。

In that sense, the complex skills of building a car have been transferred from the master craftsman up to the factory system, which has gotten very complex, with  computer-controlled  assembly  lines  and  inventory  management.
从这个意义上说，制造汽车的复杂技能，已经从工匠大师转移到工厂系统，工厂系统变得非常复杂，它有计算机控制的装配线和库存管理。

Conversely,  the  system  tries  to  divide  labor into  as  narrow   specializations  as possible  to  cut  costs. 
相反，该系统试图将劳动力专业尽可能细分，以降低成本。

 Using  again  the  example  of  manufacturing  a  car, specialization can be narrowed to the point of replacing people with robots that weld a single piece of metal
再次使用制造汽车的例子，专业化可以缩小到，用焊接机器人代替人的地步。
