Our educational system and our business leaders all advise us to "become a
specialist." The reason is that while generalized skills are very beneficial, they
don't fit well into the existing system. The existing system requires specialists--
cogs that fit into a system that has already been built. Specialist knowledge is
much  cheaper  to  acquire  for  mass  production  purposes  than  is  generalized
knowledge. Imagine all the skills one would need to acquire to build a car from
raw minerals that were dug out of the ground. It would take a lifetime to acquire
sufficient skills to make a single car, after which one would be too old to make
more. If, instead, several people learn just one simple skill and are organized into
an assembly line, the reduced time spent on learning allows them to produce
much  more.  Given  the  limitations  of  human  intelligence  and  lifespan,
specialization is the only way to rapidly produce sophisticated products.
In that sense, the complex skills of building a car have been transferred from
the master craftsman up to the factory system, which has gotten very complex,
with  computer-controlled  assembly  lines  and  inventory  management.
Conversely,  the  system  tries  to  divide  labor into  as  narrow  specializations  as
possible  to  cut  costs.  Using  again  the  example  of  manufacturing  a  car,
specialization can be narrowed to the point of replacing people with robots that
weld a single piece of metal
