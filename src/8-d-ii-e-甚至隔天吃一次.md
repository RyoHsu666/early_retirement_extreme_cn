In fact, studies show that eating every other day, even  when  eating  several  meals  that  day,  may  increase  longevity  in  the  same way  that  constant  caloric  restriction  does,  at  least  in  lab  mice.92  Caloric restriction  has  been  shown  to  extend  longevity in  two  senses:  not  only  does  it mean  more  years  of  life,  it  means  more  healthy  years,  as  the  body  shows increased  resistance  to  cancer  and  other  degenerative  diseases. 
事实上，研究表明，每隔一天吃一次，即使当天吃了几顿饭，也可能会像持续限制热量一样延长寿命，至少在实验室小鼠中是如此。卡路里限制已被证明可以在两个方面延长寿命：它不仅意味着寿命更长，还意味着更健康，因为身体对癌症和其他退行性疾病的抵抗力增强。
It's  a  subject worth studying.
这是一个值得研究的课题。
