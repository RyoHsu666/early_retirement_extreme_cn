Freeing oneself from the timing of even the evening meal is very liberating. 

All meals can now be eaten at home. 

Even missing one meal, that is, not eating for 48 hours, becomes possible. 

In fact, studies show that eating every other day, even  when  eating  several  meals  that  day,  may  increase  longevity  in  the  same way  that  constant  caloric  restriction  does,  at  least  in  lab  mice.92  Caloric restriction  has  been  shown  to  extend  longevity in  two  senses:  not  only  does  it mean  more  years  of  life,  it  means  more  healthy  years,  as  the  body  shows increased  resistance  to  cancer  and  other  degenerative  diseases. 

It's  a  subject worth studying.
