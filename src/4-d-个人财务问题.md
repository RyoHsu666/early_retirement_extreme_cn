Finance is the process of exchanging cash flows between one period in time and another through the use of financial contracts.
金融是通过使用金融合同，在一个时期和另一个时期之间，交换现金流的过程。
The cost of this exchange is the interest paid by the borrower (see Financial cash flow cycles).
这种交换的成本是借款人支付的利息（参见[现金流循环]()）。
The longer the time period, the higher the interest.
时间越长，利息越高。
The interest will always be paid in the future, by definition.
根据定义，利息将始终在未来支付。
The only possible cost in the present is a fee.
目前唯一可能的成本是费用。
A typical example is the  simple  interest  loan  where  the  lender  lends  the  borrower  a  sum--the principal--in exchange for regular payments of interest until a day in the future when  the  borrower  will  pay  the  full  principal  back  to  the  lender.
一个典型的例子是单利贷款，贷款人借给借款人一笔钱——本金——作为定期支付利息的交换，直到将来某一天，借款人将全额本金偿还给贷款人。
Another example is the fully amortizing loan where the lender is paid back in constant payments comprising decreasing amounts of interest and increasing amounts of principal  over  the  period  of  the  loan.
另一个例子是完全分期偿还贷款，贷款人在贷款期间以固定付款的形式偿还，包括利息金额减少和本金金额增加。
Typically  a  fee  is  also  added  to  the payments.
通常，费用也会添加到付款中。

Financing is a useful business tool.
融资是一种有用的商业工具。
A business is an organization that exists primarily to generate profit for its owners through the sale of goods or services to consumers and the employment of workers.
企业是一个组织，它主要通过向消费者销售商品或服务以及雇佣工人，为其所有者创造利润。
Others would say that businesses exist primarily to keep folks busy--that is, to provide jobs.
其他人会说，企业的存在主要是为了让人们忙碌——也就是说，提供就业机会。
Using financing, a business  can  leverage  its  operations  by  borrowing  money  to  spend  on investments to increase future revenues.
通过融资，企业可以通过借钱用于投资以增加未来收入来利用其运营。
Future payments of debt and interest are then made using the higher revenue.
然后使用较高的收入，来支付未来的债务和利息。
This shifts the cost of money from a less productive present to a more productive future and allows the business to earn profit faster and earn more profit compared to a business that operates without debt
这将资金成本，从生产率较低的当前转移到生产率较高的未来，与无债务经营的企业相比，这使得企业能够更快地赚取利润，赚取更多利润。
