Finance is the process of exchanging cash flows between one period in time and another through the use of financial contracts.

The cost of this exchange is the interest paid by the borrower (see Financial cash flow cycles).

The longer the time period, the higher the interest.

The interest will always be paid in the future, by definition.

The only possible cost in the present is a fee.

A typical example is the  simple  interest  loan  where  the  lender  lends  the  borrower  a  sum--the principal--in exchange for regular payments of interest until a day in the future when  the  borrower  will  pay  the  full  principal  back  to  the  lender.

Another example is the fully amortizing loan where the lender is paid back in constant payments comprising decreasing amounts of interest and increasing amounts of principal  over  the  period  of  the  loan.

Typically  a  fee  is  also  added  to  the payments.


Financing is a useful business tool.

A business is an organization that exists primarily to generate profit for its owners through the sale of goods or services to consumers and the employment of workers.

Others would say that businesses exist primarily to keep folks busy--that is, to provide jobs.

Using financing, a business  can  leverage  its  operations  by  borrowing  money  to  spend  on investments to increase future revenues.

Future payments of debt and interest are then made using the higher revenue.

This shifts the cost of money from a less productive present to a more productive future and allows the business to earn profit faster and earn more profit compared to a business that operates without debt
