All  systems  possess  ecological  knowledge  intuitively  through  evolutionary means. 
所有系统都通过进化手段，直观地拥有生态知识。
 Being  part  of  an  ecological  system,  humans  used  to  possess  this knowledge  as  well. 
作为生态系统的一部分，人类过去也拥有这种知识。
 However,  technology  has  created  an  aberrated  bubble, screening  people  from  this  knowledge. 
然而，技术制造了一个畸形的泡沫，将人们从这种知识中筛选出来。
 Most  people  are  therefore  no  longer capable of thinking in ecological terms. 
因此，大多数人不再能够从生态学的角度思考问题。
Indeed, it has resulted in a new kind of system  which,  like  all  young  systems,  is  more  focused  on  exponential  growth, production,  expansion,  and  quantity  rather  than  stability,  protection, consolidation, and quality, which are the marks of a mature system. 
事实上，它产生了一种新的系统，与所有年轻的系统一样，它更注重指数增长、生产、扩张和数量，而不是稳定、保护、整合和质量，这才是一个成熟系统的标志。

Unfortunately for the existing mature systems in nature, the rapid expansion of  the  human  bubble  is  destroying  them.  
不幸的是，对于自然界现有的成熟系统来说，人类泡沫的迅速膨胀正在摧毁它们。
Unfortunately  for  us,  we  can't  exist without them any more than a living person can exist without oxygen or a body can exist without a head. 
不幸的是，对我们来说，没有它们我们就无法生存，正如一个活人没有氧气就无法生存，一个身体没有脑袋也无法生存一样。
In this sense, it is actually a conceptual error to define the environment as the rest of the biosphere save humans, and think of ourselves as apart from it, since we can't exist without it. 
从这个意义上讲，将环境排除在生物圈中拯救人类的部分之外，并将我们自己与之分离，实际上是一个概念上的错误，因为没有环境我们就无法生存。

Aside  from  the  continued  existence  of  humanity,  ecological  understanding includes many principles about the organization of complex systems which are very  useful  for  living  as  a  Renaissance  man. 
除了人类的持续存在之外，生态理解还包括许多关于复杂系统组织的原则，这些原则对于文艺复兴时人类生活将非常有用。
 Ecological  goals  for  someone aspiring to be a Renaissance man are to 
对于渴望成为文艺复兴人的人来说，生态目标是 
 know the names of five grasses, five birds, five trees, etc. 
- 知道五种草、五种鸟、五种树的名字等等。
local to your area, and be able to recognize them. 
- 定位你所在的区域，并且能够识别它们。
know  which  food  is  in  season  and  how  much  oil,  water,  and  fertilizer  it takes  to  grow/raise  the  food  (out  of  season,  out  of  location)  and  how  it  is sensitive to Liebig's Law of the minimum. 
- 知道哪些食物正处于生长季节，需要多少油、水和肥料来生长、饲养食物（非季节、非地点），以及它对李比希最低量定律的敏感性。
grow and sustain a garden without using pesticides, hybrid seeds, chemical- based fertilizer, etc. A garden and indeed any system will achieve maximum integrity  when  it  is  in  balance,  and  when  growth  is  stable  and  resilient without ongoing external interference. 
- 在不使用杀虫剂、杂交种子、化学肥料等的情况下种植和维持花园。
promote functional diversity to retain adaptive capacity, to allow evolution to  happen  when  the  environment  changes.  Adaptive  and  evolutionary potential  should  be  considered  before  interfering.  Actions  always  have reactions, and so action is not always a good idea. 
- 促进功能多样性以保持适应能力，在环境变化时允许进化。干预前应考虑适应性和进化潜力。行动总是有反作用的，所以行动并不总是一个好主意。
always  consider  the  system  and  understand  both  the  parts  and  the  whole. No  parts  exist  without  the  whole  and  the  whole  doesn't  exist  without  the parts. Everything  is  related  to  everything  else,  mostly  indirectly. Thus, changing one part will change the whole. 
- 永远要考虑系统，理解部分和整体。没有整体就没有部分，没有部分就没有整体。每件事都与其他一切有关，大多是间接的。因此，改变一部分就会改变整个。
recognize  multiple  bottom  lines,  flows,  and  balances  in  terms  of  primary, secondary, and tertiary consumers, producers, and decomposers. 
- 从一级、二级和三级消费者、生产者和分解者的角度识别多个底线、流量和平衡。
use the maximum power principle (see Appropriate response), which states that systems strive to maximize the rate of useful work--that is, to not waste energy to its environment. 
使用最大功率原则（参见[恰当的反应]()），该原则指出系统努力最大化有用功的速率，即不向环境浪费能源。
understand  the  concept  of  characteristic  scales  in  terms  of  change  and  the effect of limits on competition and cooperation. Understand  the  difference between  positive  feedbacks  and  negative  feedbacks  (both  are  needed)  and how linking feedbacks lead to cycles, runaways, or overshoots. 
- 从变化和限制对竞争与合作的影响方面，理解特征量表的概念。了解正反馈和负反馈（两者都是必需的）之间的区别，以及链接反馈如何导致周期、失控或超调。
study the structure and principles of different systems to build a collection of models, in order to understand other systems.
- 研究不同系统的结构和原理，构建模型集合，以便了解其他系统。
