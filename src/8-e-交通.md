Travel is the process of getting from A to B and transportation is the means of  travel.
旅行是从A到B的过程，交通是旅行的手段。
Solving  the  transportation  problem  starts  by  strategically  minimizing the distance between A and B, as described in How to find shelter.
解决交通问题首先要有策略地缩短A和B之间的距离，如[如何寻找避护所]()中所述。
Successfully minimizing this distance permits walking and cycling.
步行和骑自行车可以成功地缩短这段距离。
Not having a car saves a lot  of  money  (see  Driving)  and  moving  around  by  muscle  power  increases fitness--countries  show  an  inverse  correlation  between  obesity  and  miles traveled  under  human  power.
没有车可以节省很多钱（参见[开车]()），靠肌肉力量四处走动可以增强体质——各国显示，肥胖与驾驶里程呈负相关。
This  in  turn  can  substitute  for  an  entire  cardio program by either running or doing interval cycling (pick a mile marker and go all out until you hit level 8) on the way home.
这反过来可以替代整个有氧运动计划，在回家的路上跑步或做骑自行车（选择一个里程标记，全力以赴，直到你达到8级）。
If you planned the location of your residence relative to your work properly, it's not very far.
如果你规划好了住所相对于工作的位置，那就不会太远。

One strategy, is to think of cars as recreational vehicles, like I believe they were originally intended to be.
其中一个策略是把汽车想象成休闲车，就像我认为它们最初的意图一样。
As such, use them for tours on weekends and use your  feet  or  your  bike  on  weekdays,  rather  than  the  other  way  around.
因此，在周末旅游时使用它们，在工作日使用你的脚或自行车，而不是相反。
This requires a lot of discipline, so it may be better to get rid of the car outright and rent one on weekends.
这需要很多纪律，所以最好干脆把车扔掉，在周末租一辆。
