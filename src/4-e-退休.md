Retirement is a relatively new phenomenon

退休是一个相对较新的现象。

 It comes from people having decided that rather than using the time-saving technology and inventions that appeared around the first half of the 20th century to live a life of leisure, they would live a life of shopping and work until they could no longer function as useful--that is, income-earning--units in the production chain and had to be set aside

它来自人们这样的决定，与其使用节省时间的技术和发明（20世纪上半叶左右出现的）来过休闲的生活，不如过上购物和工作的生活，直到他们变得无用为止。生产链中有用的——即赚取收入的——单位，不得不被放到一边。

With the institutionalization of society, where work and life and practically any and all activities are separated in space as well as time, people who were institutionalized as children are inclined to institutionalize their aging parents in retirement homes in return (see here)

随着社会的制度化，工作和生活在空间和时间上都是分开的，作为回应，儿童时期被制度化的人，倾向于将他们年迈的父母安置在养老院（见[这里]()）。

 At these retirement homes, retirees spend their  time  doing  the  equivalent  of  after-school  activities,  with  the  family dropping in during major holidays, if they can find the time

在这些养老院，退休人员花时间做相当于放学后的活动，如果他们的家人有时间的话，会在重大假期时来访。

 This is considered
normal

这被认为很正常。

Those  who  have  accumulated  a  large  amount  of  savings  earlier  than
everybody  else  thanks  to  uncommonly  high  savings  rates  or  stock  options
sometimes take early retirement

由于异常高的储蓄率或股票期权，那些比其他人更早积累大量储蓄的人有时会提前退休。

 This kind of early retirement resembles a long
vacation, which is essentially what it is

这种提前退休本质上就像一个长假。

 The retiree has no immediate plans to be
productive, and if he did, he would just go back to his old job where his earning
power presumably would be highest

退休人员没有立即提高生产力的计划，如果他这样做了，他就会回到原来的工作岗位，在那里他的赚钱能力可能是最高的。

 Instead, money is spent flying to exotic destinations,  sporting  events,  or  far-flung  friends  and  relatives,  although  golf, fishing,  motorboating,  and  other  nonstrenuous  physical  activities  have  gained some popularity.

取而代之的是，尽管高尔夫、钓鱼、摩托艇和其他不费力的体育活动已经受到一些欢迎，但人们将钱花在飞往异国情调的目的地、体育赛事或远方的亲朋好友上。

 Although relatively rare--after all, there can only be so many financially independent people in a society--this is the kind of early retirement most  people  are  familiar  with  and  dream  about,  the  kind  of  retirement  that revolves around spending  money

虽然比较少见——毕竟一个社会上经济独立的人只有这么多——这是大多数人熟悉和梦想的提前退休，那种围绕着花钱的退休。
