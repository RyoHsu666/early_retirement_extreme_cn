Retirement is a relatively new phenomenon. It comes from people having
decided that rather than using the time-saving technology and inventions that
appeared around the first half of the 20th century to live a life of leisure, they
would live a life of shopping and work until they could no longer function as
useful--that is, income-earning--units in the production chain and had to be set
aside.
With the institutionalization of society, where work and life and practically
any and all activities are separated in space as well as time, people who were
institutionalized as children are inclined to institutionalize their aging parents in
retirement homes in return (see here). At these retirement homes, retirees spend
their  time  doing  the  equivalent  of  after-school  activities,  with  the  family
dropping in during major holidays, if they can find the time. This is considered
normal.
Those  who  have  accumulated  a  large  amount  of  savings  earlier  than
everybody  else  thanks  to  uncommonly  high  savings  rates  or  stock  options
sometimes take early retirement. This kind of early retirement resembles a long
vacation, which is essentially what it is. The retiree has no immediate plans to be
productive, and if he did, he would just go back to his old job where his earning
power presumably would be highest. Instead, money is spent flying to exotic
destinations,  sporting  events,  or  far-flung  friends  and  relatives,  although  golf,
fishing,  motorboating,  and  other  nonstrenuous  physical  activities  have  gained
some popularity. Although relatively rare--after all, there can only be so many
financially independent people in a society--this is the kind of early retirement
most  people  are  familiar  with  and  dream  about,  the  kind  of  retirement  that
revolves around spending money.
