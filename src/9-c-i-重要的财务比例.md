Within the field of personal finance there is a lot of discussion about salaries, net worths, and what one's "number" (savings needed to retire) is.
在个人理财领域，有很多关于工资、净资产和个人“数字”（退休所需储蓄）的讨论。

然而，在分析不同人群的财务状况时，更合理的做法是查看比率而不是绝对数字，以了解某人的表现。
This is no different than analyzing financial statements of different-sized companies by dividing by equity, earnings, assets, etc.
这和通过除以股权、收益、资产等，来分析不同规模公司的财务报表没有区别。
or by gauging the strength of a person relative to his bodyweight rather than his absolute strength.
或者通过测量一个人的力量相对于他的体重，而不是他的绝对力量。
