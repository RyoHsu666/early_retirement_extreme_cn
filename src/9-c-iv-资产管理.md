Asset-based income is fundamentally different from work-based income. 
基于资产的收入与基于工作的收入根本不同。
The primary difference is that asset-based income is proportional to assets and skill, whereas work-based income is proportional to time spent and skill. 
主要区别在于，基于资产的收入与资产和技能成比例，而基于工作的收入与花费的时间和技能成比例。
Both  require  skills,  albeit  different  skills,  so  the  difference  is  time  versus assets. 
两者都需要技能，尽管技能不同，因此时间与资产是不同的。
 Naturally,  asset management  requires  some  time--for  example,  to  think and  observe--and  work  requires  some  assets  like  tools  and  resources,  but  the ratio between them is markedly different. 
当然，资产管理需要一些时间——比如思考和观察——工作需要一些资产，比如工具和资源，但它们之间的比例明显不同。
Consider  a  scenario  where  $2,000  in  assets  yields  4%  ($80)  without  effort, but  where  asset  management  will  raise  the  yield  to  6%  ($120). 
考虑一种情况，2000美元的资产在不付出努力的情况下收益4%（80美元），但资产管理将把收益率提高到6%（120美元）。
 This  is  a difference of $40 from a few hours of work--it's presumed that the hours spent learning to do this work won't need to be repeated; once learned, there's no need to  relearn. 
几小时的工作相差40美元——据推测，学习做这项工作所花费的时间不需要重复；一旦学会了，就没有必要重新学习。
 Spending  more  than  a  couple  hours  managing  $1,000  in  assets  is therefore  not  worthwhile,  as  the  hourly  return  on  time  would  dip  below  the working wage. 
因此，花几个小时以上管理1000美元的资产是不值得的，因为每小时的回报率将低于工作工资。
 Now  consider  having  $200,000  in  assets  yielding  4%  ($8,000). 
现在考虑拥有20万美元的资产，收益4%（8000美元）。
Raising the yield to 6% ($12,000) is a difference of $4,000, which is a very nice return  for  a  few  hours  of  effort,  the  exact  same  work  effort  but  now  leveraged with  more  assets. 
将收益率提高到6%（12000美元）是4000美元的差额，这对于几个小时的努力来说是一个非常好的回报，同样的努力，但现在有更多的资产。
 Two  observations:  First,  with  almost  no  assets,  the  hourly compensation  is  too  low  to  bother  managing  the  assets. 
两个观察结果：首先，由于几乎没有资产，单位时间的回报太低，就不需要管理资产。
 Conversely,  with  six- figure assets, the hourly return can be substantial. 
相反，拥有六位数的资产，每小时的回报可能相当可观。
Second, even when the hourly wage is substantial, asset management doesn't allow you to keep increasing your income by  putting  in more hours like  working does. 
第二，即使小时工资很高，资产管理也不允许你像工作一样，投入更多的时间来不断增加收入。
 The  total  compensation is thus less than what could be made while working for money until assets exceed income  by  a  factor  25  or  more. 
因此，在资产超过收入的25倍或更多之前，总薪酬低于为钱工作时所能获得的薪酬。
 Since  few  people  have  that  kind  of  money, they're often advised to apply the minimum amount of effort when it comes to investing. 
由于很少有人有这样的钱，所以人们经常建议他们，在投资时尽可能少地付出努力。
With  asset  management,  skill  and  wisdom  are  rewarded  directly proportionally to the asset base, but never proportionally to the time base. 
通过资产管理，技能和智慧的回报直接与资产基础成比例，但决不与时间基础成比例。
This is probably the most important cultural barrier to overcome in a society that prides itself on being busy and productive. 
在一个以忙碌和高效为荣的社会里，这可能是需要克服的最重要的文化障碍。
Frequently, asset managers get wealthy just by waiting and being wise. 
通常，资产管理公司通过等待和明智而致富。
The real challenge, especially faced by professional asset  managers,  but  hopefully  not  by  you,  is  the  tendency  to  ignore  this  fact. 
真正的挑战是，忽视这一事实的倾向，这尤其是职业资产管理者面临的挑战，但希望不是你面临的挑战。
Many associate effort with taking action, but not taking action is also a form of action. 
许多人将努力与采取行动联系起来，但不采取行动也是一种行动形式。
In fact, often not taking action is just what is required. 
事实上，经常不采取行动正是需要的。
The easiest way to get in the right frame of mind is to stop thinking like a farmer and start thinking like a hunter. 
进入正确心态的最简单方法是，停止像农民一样思考，开始像猎人一样思考。
A farmer (and a modern salary-, working-, and businessman) gets rewarded  by  activity. 
农民（以及现代的工薪、工人和商人阶层）通过活动获得奖励。
 The  more  he  does,  the  greater  his  reward. 
他做得越多，回报就越大。
 Conversely,  a hunter  isn't  going  to  catch  anything  if  he  thrashes  around  in  the  woods, frantically looking for prey. 
相反，如果一个猎人在树林里四处打猎，疯狂地寻找猎物，他就什么也抓不到。
A strategy where he first identifies the best place to hunt (skill), and then waits patiently for the opportunity to present itself, will be more successful. 
如果他首先确定最佳狩猎地点（技能），然后耐心等待机会出现，那么这种策略将更加成功。
In this sense, the farmer-turned-hunter is his own worst enemy. 
从这个意义上说，从农民变成猎人是他自己最大的敌人。
Patience  is  a  virtue  that  can  take  years  or  maybe  even  decades  to  develop. 
耐心是一种美德，可能需要几年甚至几十年才能培养出来。
 An impatient  investor  is  likely  to  fire  off  all  his  arrows  before  the  situation  is optimal  and  will  never  make  as  much  money  as  someone  who  can  wait. 
一个不耐烦的投资者，很可能会在形势达到最佳状态之前，射出所有的箭，而且永远不会像那些，能够等待的人那样，赚到那么多钱。
Conversely, an impatient farmer will keep his beds free of weeds  and  therefore impatience and a strong inclination towards productivity works for him. 
相反，一个不耐烦的农民将保持他的苗床上没有杂草，因为，不耐烦和对生产力的强烈追求对他来说是有用的。
The  goal  of  asset  management  or  any  management  is  to  either  create  an environment or alternatively be in an environment that allows for optimal yield. 
资产管理或任何管理的目标都是创造一个环境，或处于一个允许实现最佳收益的环境中。
Here optimal could mean the largest possible, the largest possible when adjusted for  volatility,  or  the  largest  possible  when  adjusted  for  catastrophic  loss. 
这里的“最优”可以是指最大的可能，在对波动性进行调整时的最大可能，或者在对灾难性损失进行调整时的最大可能。
 Like traditional  management,  micromanagement,  which  tries  to  increase  yield  by substituting time for assets, never provides the intended results.
 与传统管理一样，试图用时间代替资产，来提高收益率的微观管理，从来没有达到过预期的效果。
