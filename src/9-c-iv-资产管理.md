Asset-based income is fundamentally different from work-based income. 

The primary difference is that asset-based income is proportional to assets and skill, whereas work-based income is proportional to time spent and skill. 

Both  require  skills,  albeit  different  skills,  so  the  difference  is  time  versus assets. 

 Naturally,  asset management  requires  some  time--for  example,  to  think and  observe--and  work  requires  some  assets  like  tools  and  resources,  but  the ratio between them is markedly different. 

Consider  a  scenario  where  $2,000  in  assets  yields  4%  ($80)  without  effort, but  where  asset  management  will  raise  the  yield  to  6%  ($120). 

 This  is  a difference of $40 from a few hours of work--it's presumed that the hours spent learning to do this work won't need to be repeated; once learned, there's no need to  relearn. 

 Spending  more  than  a  couple  hours  managing  $1,000  in  assets  is therefore  not  worthwhile,  as  the  hourly  return  on  time  would  dip  below  the working wage. 

 Now  consider  having  $200,000  in  assets  yielding  4%  ($8,000). 

Raising the yield to 6% ($12,000) is a difference of $4,000, which is a very nice return  for  a  few  hours  of  effort,  the  exact  same  work  effort  but  now  leveraged with  more  assets. 

 Two  observations:  First,  with  almost  no  assets,  the  hourly compensation  is  too  low  to  bother  managing  the  assets. 

 Conversely,  with  six- figure assets, the hourly return can be substantial. 

Second, even when the hourly wage is substantial, asset management doesn't allow you to keep increasing your income by  putting  in more hours like  working does. 

 The  total  compensation is thus less than what could be made while working for money until assets exceed income  by  a  factor  25  or  more. 

 Since  few  people  have  that  kind  of  money, they're often advised to apply the minimum amount of effort when it comes to investing. 

With  asset  management,  skill  and  wisdom  are  rewarded  directly proportionally to the asset base, but never proportionally to the time base. 

This is probably the most important cultural barrier to overcome in a society that prides itself on being busy and productive. 

Frequently, asset managers get wealthy just by waiting and being wise. 

The real challenge, especially faced by professional asset  managers,  but  hopefully  not  by  you,  is  the  tendency  to  ignore  this  fact. 

Many associate effort with taking action, but not taking action is also a form of action. 

In fact, often not taking action is just what is required. 

The easiest way to get in the right frame of mind is to stop thinking like a farmer and start thinking like a hunter. 

A farmer (and a modern salary-, working-, and businessman) gets rewarded  by  activity. 

 The  more  he  does,  the  greater  his  reward. 

 Conversely,  a hunter  isn't  going  to  catch  anything  if  he  thrashes  around  in  the  woods, frantically looking for prey. 

A strategy where he first identifies the best place to hunt (skill), and then waits patiently for the opportunity to present itself, will be more successful. 

In this sense, the farmer-turned-hunter is his own worst enemy. 

Patience  is  a  virtue  that  can  take  years  or  maybe  even  decades  to  develop. 

 An impatient  investor  is  likely  to  fire  off  all  his  arrows  before  the  situation  is optimal  and  will  never  make  as  much  money  as  someone  who  can  wait. 

Conversely, an impatient farmer will keep his beds free of weeds  and  therefore impatience and a strong inclination towards productivity works for him. 

The  goal  of  asset  management  or  any  management  is  to  either  create  an environment or alternatively be in an environment that allows for optimal yield. 

Here optimal could mean the largest possible, the largest possible when adjusted for  volatility,  or  the  largest  possible  when  adjusted  for  catastrophic  loss. 

 Like traditional  management,  micromanagement,  which  tries  to  increase  yield  by substituting time for assets, never provides the intended results.
