To  understand  a  system  and  its  constraints,  

为了了解一个系统和它的约束，

it  is  often  helpful  to  identify
degrees  of  freedom  to  see  what  possibilities  exist  within  the  system. 

标定一个系统的自由度，看看系统存在多少种可能性，这经常是非常有帮助的。


 For
instance, a train has one degree of freedom: It can move forwards or backwards.
A car has two degrees of freedoms. It can move forwards, backwards, left, or
right.18 
例如，一个火车有一个自由度：它只能向前和向后移动。汽车有两个自由度，它能向前，向后，向左，向右移动。

However, when one degree of freedom has been hidden it can be difficult
to identify it. For instance, if all cars were sold with a locked steering wheel, cars
could only go forward or backward. Soon this restricted behavior would become
normal. Roads would be designed to make driving without turning the wheels
easier. The purpose of the steering wheel would be forgotten. First it would be
turned into a clothes hanger, like much home exercise equipment. In later models
it might be eliminated altogether.
A society that worships conformity has zero apparent degrees of freedom.
This may be hard to understand in a consumer society which prides itself on
choice. However, while the choices are abundant, they're restricted to a fairly
narrow  range.  Consider  shaving  kits  for  men.  These  are  restricted  to  various
multi-bladed safety razors, in which a below-cost handle locks the consumer into
a product line, after which more expensive replacement blades can be sold to
recover the cost. It's getting increasingly hard to find the old flat single safety
razor blades that can be sharpened. A straight razor can only be bought from
barbershops, hairdressers, or specialized shops on the Internet. Not shaving at all
is sure to make a person stand out. Thus, this is an example where the degrees of
freedom for the consumer have been eliminated. It also shows the possibility of
finding other solutions.
In democratic societies with a free market, and certain other societies as well,
the economic possibilities of a member of society can be described with at least
two degrees of freedom, as shown in this figure. One axis describes the linearity
of the person's activities, while the other axis describes the coupling between the
person and the activities, typically through an economic system
