To  understand  a  system  and  its  constraints,  

为了了解一个系统和它的约束，

it  is  often  helpful  to  identify
degrees  of  freedom  to  see  what  possibilities  exist  within  the  system. 

标定一个系统的自由度，看看系统存在多少种可能性，这经常是非常有帮助的。


 For
instance, a train has one degree of freedom: It can move forwards or backwards.
A car has two degrees of freedoms. It can move forwards, backwards, left, or
right.18 
例如，一个火车有一个自由度：它只能向前和向后移动。汽车有两个自由度，它能向前，向后，向左，向右移动。

However, when one degree of freedom has been hidden it can be difficult
to identify it. 

但是，当隐藏了一个自由度时，就很难识别它。

For instance, if all cars were sold with a locked steering wheel, cars
could only go forward or backward. Soon this restricted behavior would become
normal.

例如，如果出售的所有汽车都带有锁定的方向盘，则汽车只能前进或后退。很快，这种受限制的行为就会成为常态。

 Roads would be designed to make driving without turning the wheels
easier. 

道路将被设计成无需转动车轮，也能容易驾驶。

The purpose of the steering wheel would be forgotten. First it would be
turned into a clothes hanger, like much home exercise equipment. 

方向盘的用途会被忘记。它会变成一个衣架，就像许多家庭健身器材一样。

In later models
it might be eliminated altogether.
A society that worships conformity has zero apparent degrees of freedom.
This may be hard to understand in a consumer society which prides itself on
choice. 

在以后的模型中，它可能会被完全消除。一个崇尚从众的社会的表面自由度为零。在以选择为荣的消费社会中，这可能很难理解。

However, while the choices are abundant, they're restricted to a fairly
narrow  range. 

然而，虽然选择很丰富，但它们仅限于相当狭窄的范围。

 Consider  shaving  kits  for  men.  These  are  restricted  to  various
multi-bladed safety razors, in which a below-cost handle locks the consumer into
a product line, after which more expensive replacement blades can be sold to
recover the cost.

考虑男士剃须套件。这些仅限于各种多刀片的安全剃须刀，其中一个低于成本的手柄将消费者锁定在产品线中，之后可以出售更昂贵的替换刀片以收回成本。

 It's getting increasingly hard to find the old flat single safety
razor blades that can be sharpened.

越来越难找到可以磨锋利的旧式刀片了。

 A straight razor can only be bought from
barbershops, hairdressers, or specialized shops on the Internet. Not shaving at all
is sure to make a person stand out.

剃须刀只能从理发店、美发店或互联网上的专卖店购买。根本不刮胡子肯定会让一个人脱颖而出。

 Thus, this is an example where the degrees of
freedom for the consumer have been eliminated. 

因此，这是一个消除消费者自由度的例子。

It also shows the possibility of
finding other solutions.

它还显示了找到其他解决方案的可能性。

In democratic societies with a free market, and certain other societies as well,
the economic possibilities of a member of society can be described with at least
two degrees of freedom, as shown in this figure.

在具有自由市场的民主社会以及某些其他社会中，社会成员的经济可能性至少可以用两个自由度来描述，如[图]()所示。

 One axis describes the linearity
of the person's activities, while the other axis describes the coupling between the
person and the activities, typically through an economic system

一个轴描述了人的活动的线性，而另一个轴描述了人与活动之间的耦合，通常是通过经济系统来实现的
