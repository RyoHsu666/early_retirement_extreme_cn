Those  who  take  care  of  their  stuff  will  likely  be  able  to  use  their  current inventory for several years before using it up.
那些负责保管自己物品的人，可能需要数年来用完他们现有的库存。
For instance, in my experience one towel will last four years if it's the only one in use.
例如，根据我的经验，一条毛巾可以使用四年。
Consequently, a set of four towels in rotation will last a good 16 years.
因此，一套四条毛巾轮换使用将是16年。
Similarly, if t-shirts can be washed 100 times,61 are only worn once between washings, one is worn every day, and you have 15 of them--which shouldn't be a problem if you participate in a few events that give you a free t-shirt each year--you have enough t-shirts to last four years.
类似地，如果T恤可以洗100次，两次洗涤之间只穿一次，每天穿一件，你有15件——如果你参加一些活动，每年给你一件免费的T恤，这应该不是问题——你有足够的T恤穿四年。
Unlike  cars  and  computers,  which  start  failing  "all  over"  once  the  first failures start to appear,62  clothes have known weak spots--for example, armpit, shoulder, and crotch seams or heels and toes in socks.
与汽车和电脑不同的是，衣服有已知的弱点，例如腋窝、肩膀、胯部接缝，袜子中的脚腕和脚趾。汽车和电脑一旦出现第一次故障，就会“全面”出现故障。
Learn to mend these.
学会修补这些。
You  can  make  a  sport  out  of  extending  the  wear.
你可以通过一些活动来延长穿着时间。
For  instance,  bed  sheets generally  wear  out  in  the  middle  (the  middle  part  covers  the  body).
例如，床单一般在中间磨损（中间部分覆盖身体）。
When  it finally rips (this takes 3-4 years if you only have one set, and why own more?), you can cut it in half along the middle and sew the sides together to become the new middle.
当它最终破裂时（如果你只有一套，这需要3-4年的时间，为什么还要拥有更多？），你可以沿着中间把它切成两半，然后把两边缝在一起成为新的中间。
This is how people used to do it, but I must admit that today fabric is  so  cheap  that  I'd  just  get  a  new  set  and  turn  the  old  sheets  into  rags  for cleaning.
以前人们就是这样做的，但我必须承认，今天的布料太便宜了，我只能买一套新的，把旧床单变成抹布。
The  benefit  of  this  exercise  is  perhaps  not  so  much  in  extending  the wear of things, but in learning what to look for when acquiring new things.
这项练习的好处也许不在于延长事物的磨损时间，而在于学会在获得新事物时寻找什么。
For instance, having noticed that the no-stick treatment for pots and pans only lasts a couple of years and that it can't, as far as I know, be replaced, get stainless steel, iron,  or  copper  the  next  time.
例如，我注意到不粘锅只持续几年，而且据我所知，它不能被更换，也不能得到不锈钢、铁或铜。
For  shoes,  get  Norwegian  welts,  which  allow  a complete replacement of the sole.
对于鞋子，可以使用挪威贴边，这样就可以完全替换鞋底。
And try to avoid plastic; it is hard to fashion plastic replacement parts on your own.
尽量避免使用塑料；你很难自己设计塑料替换件。
