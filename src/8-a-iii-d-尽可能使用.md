Those  who  take  care  of  their  stuff  will  likely  be  able  to  use  their  current inventory for several years before using it up.

For instance, in my experience one towel will last four years if it's the only one in use.

Consequently, a set of four towels in rotation will last a good 16 years.

Similarly, if t-shirts can be washed 100 times,61 are only worn once between washings, one is worn every day, and you have 15 of them--which shouldn't be a problem if you participate in a few events that give you a free t-shirt each year--you have enough t-shirts to last four years.

Unlike  cars  and  computers,  which  start  failing  "all  over"  once  the  first failures start to appear,62  clothes have known weak spots--for example, armpit, shoulder, and crotch seams or heels and toes in socks.

Learn to mend these.

You  can  make  a  sport  out  of  extending  the  wear.

For  instance,  bed  sheets generally  wear  out  in  the  middle  (the  middle  part  covers  the  body).

When  it finally rips (this takes 3-4 years if you only have one set, and why own more?), you can cut it in half along the middle and sew the sides together to become the new middle.

This is how people used to do it, but I must admit that today fabric is  so  cheap  that  I'd  just  get  a  new  set  and  turn  the  old  sheets  into  rags  for cleaning.

The  benefit  of  this  exercise  is  perhaps  not  so  much  in  extending  the wear of things, but in learning what to look for when acquiring new things.

For instance, having noticed that the no-stick treatment for pots and pans only lasts a couple of years and that it can't, as far as I know, be replaced, get stainless steel, iron,  or  copper  the  next  time.

For  shoes,  get  Norwegian  welts,  which  allow  a complete replacement of the sole.

And try to avoid plastic; it is hard to fashion plastic replacement parts on your own.
