This  equation  gives  a  quick  way  of  estimating  the  assets  required  to  be financially independent of a given recurring expense.
这个[等式]()提供了一种快速的方法，来估算在给定经常性支出下，财务独立于所需的资产。
Using a conservative rate of  return  of  3%,  we  find  P0  =  1.03/0.03  p  = 34.33  p.
使用3%的保守回报率，我们发现P0=1.03/0.03 p=34.33 p。
If  the  expense  is  given monthly,  as  many  recurring  expenses  are,  the  annual  cost  is  12  times  higher, hence 
如果费用是每月支付的，就像许多经常性费用一样，每年的成本要高出12倍，因此

P = (1+0.03/12)/(0.03/12) p = 401 p.


This  means  that  each  $1/month  not  spent  is  equivalent  to  reducing  the required  fund  size  by  $401.
这意味着每月每花1美元就相当于将所需的基金规模减少401美元。
For  example,  the  cost  of  a  $20  monthly  payment may  seem  inexpensive  to  someone  earning  $15/hour,  but  with  an  asset-based income,  it  actually  represents  $20×401  =  $8020,  which  represents  over  4 months of work at the given hourly rate.
例如，对于一个每小时收入为15美元的人来说，每月支付20美元的费用似乎不贵，但如果是以资产为基础的收入，它实际上代表了20×401=8020美元，这代表了在给定的时薪下超过4个月的工作。
Thus, frequently it costs much less to pay more for a one-time expense than to get involved in a recurring expense.
因此，通常情况下，为一次性支出支付更多的费用要比参与经常性支出的成本低得多。
If, for  example,  the  monthly  cable  bill  is  $40,  the  corresponding  asset-based equivalent  is  $16,040.
例如，如果每月电报费为40美元，则相应的基于资产的等价物为16040美元。
That  amount  can  buy  a  lot  of  movies  and  computer games,  and  those  can  be  leveraged  into  even  more  movies  and  games  by swapping them (see Bartering and swapping).
这一数额可以购买大量电影和电脑游戏，通过交换这些电影和游戏，它们可以被用来撬动更多的电影和游戏（参见[易货和交换]()）。
Costs which aren't monthly can be derived from the depreciation schedule in Depreciation schedules and converted into the required asset backing using this equation.
非月度成本可以从[折旧时间表]()中得出，并使用这个[等式]()转换为所需的资产。
