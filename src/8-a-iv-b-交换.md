Another  way  of  getting  use-value  without  paying  money  is  by  swapping.

There are several options for online swapping, which gives one access to a much larger market.

Some swapping works on a credit-based system--rather than being paid  money,  giving  away  a  book  gets  you  a  credit.

Credits  work  like  gift certificates as they can be used to order books from other people.

This avoids the friction of  having  to  find  a  specific  trading  counterpart.

Usually  these  services are offered for free, which also avoids the friction caused by commissions.

Another solution is to trade directly.

This comes with most of the problems of trade before the invention of money.

Here one has to find another person and do the swap directly.

One solution is three-way swaps: A gives to B, B gives to C,  and  C  gives  to  A.

Bartering  and  swapping  can  also  be  used  to  get  rid  of unwanted things (see How to get rid of things).

Using these methods, I have not paid for a CD or a DVD in years.
