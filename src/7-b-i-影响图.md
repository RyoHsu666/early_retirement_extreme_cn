Having realized that it is impossible to do just one thing, it follows that any
action  or  behavior  has  a  number  of  positive  or  negative  side  effects  or
consequences. 

意识到不可能只做一件事情，任何的行动和行为都会带来一堆的积极和消极的影响和后果。

Here, each side effect corresponds to a dimension in the figure. 

在这个图中，每个侧面影响都对于着一个维度。

If
you take all your actions, which are now vectors in "goal-space" and add them,
this will give a strong indication where in "goal-space" you are likely to end up
(see Ergodicity and destiny).

如果你采取所有行动，就是增加它们到现在的“目标空间”向量，这会给你提供一个强的最有可能结束的“目标空间”（参考生态和目的地）。

This figure shows a complementary way of mapping out the consequences.

这张图展示了完整的后续路径。

For  those  familiar  with  "fish  bone" diagrams,  this  is  the  reverse  of  one. 

对于那些熟悉“鱼骨图”的人来书，这是反向的。

 The
taken  position  is  a  zeroth-order  effect  and  it  has  first-order  effects. 

占位的是零阶影响和它的一阶影响。

 Positive
effects go over the line.

正向影响在线上。

 Negative effects go under the line. 
 
负向影响在线下。
 
 Each effect also has
second-order effects. 

每个影响还有二阶影响。

Positive effects go over the line. 

正向影响向上走。

Negative effects go under
the line. 

负向影响向下走。

It's difficult to say if a position that has a weak positive first-order effect
with a strong negative second-order effect or a weak negative first-order effect
with  a  strong  positive  second-order  effect  is  net  positive. 

很难说如果一个为有弱正向一阶影响和一个强的负向二阶影响，或者一个弱的负向一阶影响和一个强的二阶正向影响的网络是正向的。

 If  this  can't  be
determined, the behavior is too complicated and should be avoided (see here).

如果这个不能被确定，那么行为太过复杂需要被避免（参考这里）。

Hopefully  this  won't  be  a  problem  and  second-order  effects  can  be  ignored.

希望二阶影响被忽略不会是一个问题。

However,  sometimes  second-and  even  third-order  effects  either  add  up  or
accumulate undetected for a long time before triggering spectacular event.

然而，有些时候对于一些长时间触发的特殊事件，二阶甚至三阶影响需要被加上。

As a general rule, if adding up the side effects doesn't create a positive bias,
then the entire goal structure should be reevaluated.

作为通用的规则，如果增加侧面影响不会创建一个正向的偏置，那么整个目标结果需要被重新评估。

The goal is the horizontal line. 

目标是一个水平线。

This goal has two positive (POS) and
one negative first-order side effect (NEG). The first positive side effect has
a positive second-order side effect (POS-POS). The second positive side
effect has one positive second-order side effect (POS-POS) and two
negative second-order side effects (POS-NEG). The first negative side
effect has two positive second-order side effects (NEG-POS).
Let us consider a few examples.
这个目标有两个正面（POS）和一个负面的一阶副作用（NEG）。 第一个积极的副作用有一个积极的二阶副作用（POS-POS）。 第二个正副作用具有一个正二阶副作用 (POS-POS) 和两个负二阶副作用 (POS-NEG)。 第一个负面副作用有两个正面的二阶副作用 (NEG-POS)。
让我们考虑几个例子。

[Hobby] The zeroth-order goal is to have fun. The first-order negative side
effect is that it costs money. Another first-order negative effect is that it
may require space. This space requirement has a second-order negative side
effect in that this too requires money. A first-order positive effect may be
meeting new people. A second-order positive effect of that is that this could
allow for professional networking. A third-order positive effect is that this
could lead to a job.

【爱好】获得乐趣的零阶目标。一阶的负面影响是花钱。另一个一阶的负面影响是需要空间。空间需求有一个二阶影响是太花钱。一个一阶的正面影响可能是遇见新人。这个二阶的正面影响是能够专业化网络。一个三阶的正面影响是这能够带来工作。

[Side  business]  The  zeroth-order  goal  is  to  learn  how  to  run  a  business.
Startup  costs  are  a  first-order  negative  effect.  Income  is  a  first-order
positive effect; for many, income might be the zeroth-order goal. Running a
business has a time cost which may be positive or negative. Regardless, a
positive second-order effect of this is that this time is not spent spending
money.

【副业】零阶的目标是学习如何做生意。初创需要花钱是一阶的负面影响。收入是一阶的正面影响；对于很多人来说，收入可能是零阶的目标。做生意会花时间这可能是正面的或负面的。不管这个的话，正面的二阶影响是这个时间不是在花钱。

[Job] The zeroth-order goal is to earn money. Developing a career is a first-
order  positive  side  effect.  Being  stressed  or  unhealthy  is  a  first-order
negative  side  effect,  as  is  the  cost  of  business  attire  and  keeping  up
appearances. A second-order negative effect of this is spending money to
make up for this, either by taking drugs or shopping.

【工作】零阶的目标是赚钱。职业发展是一阶的正向影响。承受压力和不健康，以及商务打扮和外表提升的花费，是一阶的负向影响。二阶的负面影响是吃药和购物所花的钱。

These are just examples. For instance, the zeroth-order goal of the job may
be to develop a career rather than earning. 

这只是一个例子。实际可能是，工作的零阶目标是发展职业而不是赚钱。

In that case, put career as the zeroth-
order  goal  and  the  money  as  a  side  effect.  If  clothing  is  supplied,  this  is  a
positive side effect rather than a negative side effect.

在这种情况，把职业放在零阶目标那钱就是侧面影响。如果制服是提供的，这变成了正面影响而不是负面影响。

Now, think of your own reverse fish bones in terms of how you spend most
of  your  time  and  energy.  This  may  also  include  family,  education,  sports,
religion,  retirement,  etc.

现在，想想你自己如何花费你绝大多数时间和经历的反向鱼骨图。这可能包含了家庭，教育，运动，宗教，退休，等等。

,  and  things  you're  not  currently  doing  but  could  be
doing.

还有一些你现在没有做但是可能做的事情。


Consider  the  sum  total  of  all  the  effects  of  your  actions. 

考虑到你所有行动的影响总和。

 Since  adopting
specific  actions  will  lead  to  specific  outcomes,  all effects can be considered
goals, whether you actually want to achieve them or not. 

适配不同的活动会导致特定的产出，所有的影响可以被认为是目标，不管你事实上有没有达到这个目标。

You may find some of
these goals to be counterproductive. 

你可能会发现有些目标是反效率的。

Some goals involve saving money, while
others involve spending money. 

有些目标涉及了省钱，同时有些涉及花钱。

Some goals involve getting or being healthy,
while other goals are unhealthy. 

有些目标涉及了更加健康，同时有些目标让身体不健康。

Indeed, if you map out a typical lifestyle, you
will probably find a lot of counterproductivity.

事实上，如果你画出了一个典型生活的图，你可能会发现一堆反效率的目标。

 When a strong positive goal is
countered  by  smaller  negative  goals,  the  result  is  friction.  

当强的正向目标遭遇弱的负向目标时，结果时摩擦。

Friction  produces
waste (see Breaking out). 

摩擦产生浪费（参见逃离）。

Waste is prevalent in modern life. 

浪费在现代生活是普遍现象。

Just consider how
many people drive.

想想多少人开车。

 First the foot goes on the accelerator, then ten seconds later it
goes on the brake, turning kinetic energy into waste heat.

开始踩油门，十秒后踩刹车，把动能转换成了废热。

 Then it goes back on
the accelerator again to make up for the loss of speed.44 

然后又因为速度降低了再次加速。

This results in poor gas
mileage,  as  gas  is  used  to  heat  up  the  brake  pads,  and  equivalently  poor  life
mileage when the same habits are used in everyday life. 

结果就是高油耗，汽油被用来加热刹车片，并且设备也因为日常的工作习惯降低了寿命。

The same vehicle gets
different gas mileages depending on the driver.

相同汽车的不同油耗取决于司机。

 Similarly, money gets different
mileage depending on who is spending it. 

同理，相同的钱运行不同的距离取决于谁使用它。

Conversely, if one positive goal is
positively  aligned  with  another  positive  goal,  both  goals  benefit--the  vectors
point in the same direction in goal-space. 

相反的，如果一个人的正向目标和其他目标正向对齐，那么两个目标都会受益——向量在目标空间里指向了相同的方向。

To achieve such synergy, count up
actions and list the effects. 

未来达到这种协调，记下行动，列出影响。

Effects may be positive or negative. Without synergy,
negative  effects  will  often  cancel  out  positive  effects  or  effects  will  be  very
scattered. 

影响可能是正向或负向的。没有协调，负向影响会经常消耗掉正向影响或者影响会变得非常分散。

 Synergy  concentrates  the  effects  or  goals. 
 
 协调集中影响或目标。
 
  If  you  don't  see  a
concentration of goals, you must change some of your behaviors and perhaps
adopt new ones. 

如果你不能看到一个集中的目标，你必须对你的行为做出一些改变并且可能要指定一个新的目标。

For example, one of the things I had to do when starting on the
path  to  early  retirement  was  to  replace  my  money-wasting  and  generally
unproductive hobbies with hobbies there were free (see A modular design) and
meaningful  a)  to  not  cause  friction  with  my  money  saving,  b)  to  provide
meaning  that  was  unrelated  to  work,  and  c)  to  learn  new  skills  applicable  to
work (programming and writing).

例如，一件事是，当我开及早退休之路的时候，我开始把我无效的耗钱的爱好转换成免费的（参加模块化设计）和有意义的，
a) 让其不和我存钱的目标摩擦，b)提供一些和工作不相关的一样，c) 学习一些能够用到工作上的新技能（编程和写作）。
