Having realized that it is impossible to do just one thing, it follows that any
action  or  behavior  has  a  number  of  positive  or  negative  side  effects  or
consequences. 

意识到不可能只做一件事情，任何的行动和行为都会带来一堆的积极和消极的影响和后果。

Here, each side effect corresponds to a dimension in the figure. 

在这个图中，每个侧面影响都对于着一个维度。

If
you take all your actions, which are now vectors in "goal-space" and add them,
this will give a strong indication where in "goal-space" you are likely to end up
(see Ergodicity and destiny).

如果你采取所有行动，就是增加它们到现在的“目标空间”向量，这会给你提供一个强的最有可能结束的“目标空间”（参考生态和目的地）。

This figure shows a complementary way of mapping out the consequences.

这张图展示了完整的后续路径。

For  those  familiar  with  "fish  bone" diagrams,  this  is  the  reverse  of  one. 

对于那些熟悉“鱼骨图”的人来书，这是反向的。

 The
taken  position  is  a  zeroth-order  effect  and  it  has  first-order  effects. 

占位的是零阶影响和它的一阶影响。

 Positive
effects go over the line.

正向影响在线上。

 Negative effects go under the line. 
 
负向影响在线下。
 
 Each effect also has
second-order effects. 

每个影响还有二阶影响。

Positive effects go over the line. 

正向影响向上走。

Negative effects go under
the line. 

负向影响向下走。

It's difficult to say if a position that has a weak positive first-order effect
with a strong negative second-order effect or a weak negative first-order effect
with  a  strong  positive  second-order  effect  is  net  positive. 

很难说如果一个为有弱正向一阶影响和一个强的负向二阶影响，或者一个弱的负向一阶影响和一个强的二阶正向影响的网络是正向的。

 If  this  can't  be
determined, the behavior is too complicated and should be avoided (see here).

如果这个不能被确定，那么行为太过复杂需要被避免（参考这里）。

Hopefully  this  won't  be  a  problem  and  second-order  effects  can  be  ignored.

希望二阶影响被忽略不会是一个问题。

However,  sometimes  second-and  even  third-order  effects  either  add  up  or
accumulate undetected for a long time before triggering spectacular event.

然而，有些时候对于一些长时间触发的特殊事件，二阶甚至三阶影响需要被加上。

As a general rule, if adding up the side effects doesn't create a positive bias,
then the entire goal structure should be reevaluated.

作为通用的规则，如果增加侧面影响不会创建一个正向的偏置，那么整个目标结果需要被重新评估。

The goal is the horizontal line. 

目标是一个水平线。

This goal has two positive (POS) and
one negative first-order side effect (NEG). The first positive side effect has
a positive second-order side effect (POS-POS). The second positive side
effect has one positive second-order side effect (POS-POS) and two
negative second-order side effects (POS-NEG). The first negative side
effect has two positive second-order side effects (NEG-POS).
Let us consider a few examples.


[Hobby] The zeroth-order goal is to have fun. The first-order negative side
effect is that it costs money. Another first-order negative effect is that it
may require space. This space requirement has a second-order negative side
effect in that this too requires money. A first-order positive effect may be
meeting new people. A second-order positive effect of that is that this could
allow for professional networking. A third-order positive effect is that this
could lead to a job.


[Side  business]  The  zeroth-order  goal  is  to  learn  how  to  run  a  business.
Startup  costs  are  a  first-order  negative  effect.  Income  is  a  first-order
positive effect; for many, income might be the zeroth-order goal. Running a
business has a time cost which may be positive or negative. Regardless, a
positive second-order effect of this is that this time is not spent spending
money.


[Job] The zeroth-order goal is to earn money. Developing a career is a first-
order  positive  side  effect.  Being  stressed  or  unhealthy  is  a  first-order

negative  side  effect,  as  is  the  cost  of  business  attire  and  keeping  up
appearances. A second-order negative effect of this is spending money to
make up for this, either by taking drugs or shopping.
These are just examples. For instance, the zeroth-order goal of the job may
be to develop a career rather than earning. In that case, put career as the zeroth-
order  goal  and  the  money  as  a  side  effect.  If  clothing  is  supplied,  this  is  a
positive side effect rather than a negative side effect.
Now, think of your own reverse fish bones in terms of how you spend most
of  your  time  and  energy.  This  may  also  include  family,  education,  sports,
religion,  retirement,  etc.,  and  things  you're  not  currently  doing  but  could  be
doing.
Consider  the  sum  total  of  all  the  effects  of  your  actions.  Since  adopting
specific  actions  will  lead  to  specific  outcomes,  all effects can be considered
goals, whether you actually want to achieve them or not. You may find some of
these goals to be counterproductive. Some goals involve saving money, while
others involve spending money. Some goals involve getting or being healthy,
while other goals are unhealthy. Indeed, if you map out a typical lifestyle, you
will probably find a lot of counterproductivity. When a strong positive goal is
countered  by  smaller  negative  goals,  the  result  is  friction.  Friction  produces
waste (see Breaking out). Waste is prevalent in modern life. Just consider how
many people drive. First the foot goes on the accelerator, then ten seconds later it
goes on the brake, turning kinetic energy into waste heat. Then it goes back on
the accelerator again to make up for the loss of speed.44 This results in poor gas
mileage,  as  gas  is  used  to  heat  up  the  brake  pads,  and  equivalently  poor  life
mileage when the same habits are used in everyday life. The same vehicle gets
different gas mileages depending on the driver. Similarly, money gets different
mileage depending on who is spending it. Conversely, if one positive goal is
positively  aligned  with  another  positive  goal,  both  goals  benefit--the  vectors
point in the same direction in goal-space. To achieve such synergy, count up
actions and list the effects. Effects may be positive or negative. Without synergy,
negative  effects  will  often  cancel  out  positive  effects  or  effects  will  be  very
scattered.  Synergy  concentrates  the  effects  or  goals.  If  you  don't  see  a
concentration of goals, you must change some of your behaviors and perhaps
adopt new ones. For example, one of the things I had to do when starting on the
path  to  early  retirement  was  to  replace  my  money-wasting  and  generally
unproductive hobbies with hobbies there were free (see A modular design) and
meaningful  a)  to  not  cause  friction  with  my  money  saving,  b)  to  provide
meaning  that  was  unrelated  to  work,  and  c)  to  learn  new  skills  applicable  to
work (programming and writing).
