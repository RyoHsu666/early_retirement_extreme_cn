The Dark Ages was  characterized  by  an  old  and  mature  society  set  in  its ways. 
黑暗时代的特点是，一个古老而成熟的社会。
Ruled  from  the  top  down  by  kings  and  governed  by  religion,  it  was  a world of superstition and magical thinking, where the individual had few options and all cultural trends pointed towards more of the same (see The lock-in).23 It was a world ripe for new ideas. 
由国王通过宗教自上而下统治，这是一个迷信和神奇思维的世界，个人几乎没有选择，所有的文化趋势都指向更多的相同点（见[锁住]()）。这是一个打压新思想的世界。

The  Dark  Ages  gradually  ended  six  centuries  ago  with  the  Renaissance, which seeded new ideas for a different world. 
黑暗时代在六个世纪前随着文艺复兴逐渐结束，文艺复兴为一个不同的世界播下了新思想的种子。
The Renaissance ideal dominated our culture until three centuries ago, from the 14th to the 18th century, when it was superseded by modernism. 
文艺复兴理想主宰着我们的文化，从14世纪到18世纪，直到三个世纪前，它被现代主义所取代。
Not surprisingly, this human ideal has almost been forgotten in our culture. 
毫不奇怪，这种人类理想在我们的文化中几乎被遗忘了。
The Renaissance, literally "re-birth", was a revival and rediscovery of classical Greek and Roman culture following the decline of culture, trade, and technology during the Dark Ages. 
文艺复兴，字面上的“重生”，是在黑暗时代文化、贸易和技术衰落之后，古典希腊和罗马文化的复兴和重新发现。
Human achievement was once again put into the center of human focus. 
人类成就再次成为人类关注的中心。
A Renaissance man strove to develop his capabilities to their fullest extent. 
文艺复兴时期的人最大限度地发展自己的能力。

As mentioned in Succession and the cycle of change, the colonization of new habitats,  whether  physical  land  as  in  the  discovery  of  a  new  continent, physiological "land" as in breaking the four-minute mile barrier, or intellectual land as in the discovery of new ideas, immediately initiates a succession. 
正如[演替与变化周期]()中所提到的，新栖息地的殖民化，无论是发现新大陆时的物质土地，还是突破四分钟一英里障碍时的生理“土地”，还是发现新思想时的知识土地，都会立即引发演替。

As soon as those idea-seeds were sown, businessmen took unstructured but complex ideas and started commercializing them. 
这些想法一经播下，商人们就接受了无组织但复杂的想法，并开始将其商业化。
Competitively, it's easier (but also  riskier)  to  gain  an  advantage  by  leveraging  complexity  than  it  is  to specialize  while  keeping  the  slack  of  the  loose  coupling,  because  the  latter requires a lot of effort. 
在竞争中，利用复杂性比在保持松耦合的同时进行专业化更容易（但风险也更高），因为后者需要大量的努力。
Businessmen essentially move the structure from skilled artisans to factories by setting up a structure as described in The businessman. 
商人基本上通过建立一个如[生意人]()中所述的结构，将结构从熟练技工转移到工厂。
At this stage businessmen focus their efforts on competing with other businesses, until the structures for production are settled in large companies (for example, a handful of computer companies instead of the initial hundreds) and the industry is fairly stable. 
在这一阶段，商人们将精力集中在与其他企业的竞争上，直到生产结构在大公司中定型（例如，少数几家计算机公司而不是最初的数百家），然后行业就会相当稳定。
While businessmen may behave in a cutthroat fashion toward other companies, they're fairly honest with their employees. 
虽然商人可能会对其他公司采取严厉的态度，但他们对员工相当诚实。
There's a need for loyal employees to fill the jobs, and at this stage, the beginning of industry and the formation of the big corporations we still see today, the businessmen, the salarymen, and the working men form a natural symbiosis. 
需要忠诚的员工来填补这一职位，在这个阶段，工业的开始和我们今天仍然看到的大公司的形成，商人、薪水人和工人形成了一种自然的共生关系。

The  culture  moves  from  growth  to  steady  state  when  consumption  equals production. 
当消费等于生产时，文化从增长走向稳定。
At this point, all the niches have been fully filled and inter-company competition has reached a state of consolidation and "cease-fire." Now the salary men are motivated by fear of losing their job and a need to keep paying their bills rather than the desire to work for the best company. 
在这一点上，所有的小众市场（生态位）都被完全填满了，现在公司间的竞争已经达到了整合和“停火”的状态，薪水族的动机是害怕失去工作，需要继续支付账单，而不是为最好的公司工作。
The focus is thus on following  the  rules  set  down  by  the  businessmen  to  regulate  the  business. 
重点成了遵循商人制定的规则来规范业务。
However,  the  spirit  of  those  regulations  are  still  directed  towards  the competitiveness of the company. 
然而，这些法规的精神仍然是针对公司的竞争力。

Eventually, some discover that they can maximize their personal benefit not by supporting the company, but by supporting themselves. 
最终，一些人发现，他们可以通过支持自己而不是支持公司，来实现个人利益的最大化。
In other words, they become decoupled from the business. 
换句话说，他们与生意脱钩。
They start thinking about their "number"--  money in retirement accounts, broker accounts, net worth--and they develop a fascination  with  tax  deductions  and  gain  impressive  résumé-writing  and interviewing skills. 
他们开始思考自己的“数字”——退休账户中的钱、经纪人账户、净资产——他们对减税产生了兴趣，并获得了令人印象深刻的简历和面试技巧。
The entire system moves to finance, services, and politics-- all intangibles. 
整个系统转向金融、服务和政治——所有这些都是无形资产。
Having forgotten the historical background of their cultural setup, people adopt firm "social-social" beliefs that any problem can be solved in the social sphere as long as someone is given enough money to make it happen. 
人们已经忘记了文化建立的历史背景，他们获取了坚定的“社会”信念，认为只要给某人足够的钱，任何问题都可以在社会领域得到解决。
Any connection with nature and most connections with technology are lost. 
与自然的任何联系以及与技术的大部分联系都丢失了。
There's a belief that nature is irrelevant and that anything can be solved using the current methods--now technology; previously magic or praying. 
有一种信念认为，自然是无关紧要的，任何事情都可以用目前的方法——现在是技术——来解决；以前是魔法或祈祷。
We have finally arrived at a stage where people will sell their soul to build their résumé, as long as they don't break the law; where people will work in polluting manufacturing plants while being against greenhouse emissions. 
我们终于到了一个阶段，人们会出卖自己的灵魂来编写简历，只要不违法；人们在制造污染的厂工作，同时反对温室气体排放。
This progression follows a clockwise cycle in this figure, which desribes the full development of a field; each type will be dominant at some point during this progression.
如在这幅[图](../img/5-fig1.png)中描述的，这个过程遵循顺时针循环，它描述了一个领域的全面发展；在这一进程中，每种类型都将在某一点上占主导地位。
