The Dark Ages was  characterized  by  an  old  and  mature  society  set  in  its ways. 

Ruled  from  the  top  down  by  kings  and  governed  by  religion,  it  was  a world of superstition and magical thinking, where the individual had few options and all cultural trends pointed towards more of the same (see The lock-in).23 It was a world ripe for new ideas. 

The  Dark  Ages  gradually  ended  six  centuries  ago  with  the  Renaissance, which seeded new ideas for a different world. 

The Renaissance ideal dominated our culture until three centuries ago, from the 14th to the 18th century, when it was superseded by modernism. 

Not surprisingly, this human ideal has almost been forgotten in our culture. 

The Renaissance, literally "re-birth", was a revival and rediscovery of classical Greek and Roman culture following the decline of culture, trade, and technology during the Dark Ages. 

Human achievement was once again put into the center of human focus. 

A Renaissance man strove to develop his capabilities to their fullest extent. 

As mentioned in Succession and the cycle of change, the colonization of new habitats,  whether  physical  land  as  in  the  discovery  of  a  new  continent, physiological "land" as in breaking the four-minute mile barrier, or intellectual land as in the discovery of new ideas, immediately initiates a succession. 

As soon as those idea-seeds were sown, businessmen took unstructured but complex ideas and started commercializing them. 

Competitively, it's easier (but also  riskier)  to  gain  an  advantage  by  leveraging  complexity  than  it  is  to specialize  while  keeping  the  slack  of  the  loose  coupling,  because  the  latter requires a lot of effort. 

Businessmen essentially move the structure from skilled artisans to factories by setting up a structure as described in The businessman. 

At this stage businessmen focus their efforts on competing with other businesses, until the structures for production are settled in large companies (for example, a handful of computer companies instead of the initial hundreds) and the industry is fairly stable. 

While businessmen may behave in a cutthroat fashion toward other companies, they're fairly honest with their employees. 

There's a need for loyal employees to fill the jobs, and at this stage, the beginning of industry and the formation of the big corporations we still see today, the businessmen, the salarymen, and the working men form a natural symbiosis. 

The  culture  moves  from  growth  to  steady  state  when  consumption  equals production. 

At this point, all the niches have been fully filled and inter-company competition has reached a state of consolidation and "cease-fire." Now the salary men are motivated by fear of losing their job and a need to keep paying their bills rather than the desire to work for the best company. 

The focus is thus on following  the  rules  set  down  by  the  businessmen  to  regulate  the  business. 

However,  the  spirit  of  those  regulations  are  still  directed  towards  the competitiveness of the company. 

Eventually, some discover that they can maximize their personal benefit not by supporting the company, but by supporting themselves. 

In other words, they become decoupled from the business. 

They start thinking about their "number"--  money in retirement accounts, broker accounts, net worth--and they develop a fascination  with  tax  deductions  and  gain  impressive  résumé-writing  and interviewing skills. 

The entire system moves to finance, services, and politics-- all intangibles. 

Having forgotten the historical background of their cultural setup, people adopt firm "social-social" beliefs that any problem can be solved in the social sphere as long as someone is given enough money to make it happen. 

Any connection with nature and most connections with technology are lost. 

There's a belief that nature is irrelevant and that anything can be solved using the current methods--now technology; previously magic or praying. 

We have finally arrived at a stage where people will sell their soul to build their résumé, as long as they don't break the law; where people will work in polluting manufacturing plants while being against greenhouse emissions. 

This progression follows a clockwise cycle in this figure, which desribes the full development of a field; each type will be dominant at some point during this progression.
