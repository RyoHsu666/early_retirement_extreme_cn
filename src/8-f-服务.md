In  a  service  economy,  people  pay  other  people  to  raise  and  teach  their children, grow and cook their food, build and maintain their homes, make their clothes  (you  still  get  to  pick  your  own  unless  you  hire  a  personal  stylist),  etc., mostly things that we could do ourselves.99 
在服务经济中，人们付钱给其他人来抚养和教育他们的孩子，种植和烹饪他们的食物，建造和维护他们的房子，制作他们的衣服（除非你雇佣个人造型师，否则你仍然要自己挑选衣服）等等，这些大部分我们可以自己做的事情。
In return, we get to spend our time working  at  a  job,  doing  the  same  thing  most  of  the  day.
作为回报，我们可以把时间花在工作上，每天大部分时间做同样的事情。
This  arrangement follows from the economic law of comparative advantage, which is supposed to make  everybody  better  off  economically.
这种安排源自比较优势的经济法则，该法则旨在让每个人在经济上都过得更好。
There  are,  however,  parts  of  life  that are difficult to measure economically because there's no market for them.
然而，生活中的某些部分很难从经济上衡量，因为它们没有市场。
There is,  for  instance,  no  market  that  can  price  in  the  cost  of  happiness,  yours  and theirs,  in  not  raising  your  own  children.
例如，没有一个市场能以不抚养自己的孩子为代价，来衡量你和他们的幸福。
Worse,  this  arrangement  fixes  an identical price for everybody.
更糟糕的是，这种安排为每个人确定了相同的价格。
This is great for the accountant who gets paid $100 per hour, allowing him to purchase lots of services with only one hour's pay, and bad  for  the  hairdresser  who  gets  paid  $10  per  hour.
这对每小时100美元的会计师来说是好事，让他可以用一小时的工资购买很多服务，而对每小时10美元的理发师来说则是坏事。
It  would  make  financial sense for the hairdresser to serve himself for any kind of service that has a higher hourly wage than what he is paid.
对于理发师来说，为任何一种小时工资高于其工资的服务提供服务，在经济上都是合理的。
