To  a  large  extent,  weather  is  all  about  attitude  and  the  right  clothes  and shoes. 
在很大程度上，天气完全取决于态度以及合适的衣服和鞋子。
I  grew  up  in  a  place  where  it  probably  rains  200  days  a  year,  and consequently I have more than a handful of different words for different types of rain. 
我生长在一个一年大概有200天下雨的地方，因此我有很多不同的词来形容不同类型的雨。
Conversely, a few raindrops in a dry area send people scrambling for cover. 
相反，干燥地区的几滴雨滴会让人们争先恐后地寻找掩护。
Similarly, one inch of snow in a place where it never snows sends cars careening all  over  the  place. 
同样地，在一个从不下雪的地方，两厘米厚的雪会让汽车在这里颠簸。
Getting  caught  in  the  rain is  really  like  a  bear  attack. 
被困在雨中真的很像熊的袭击。
Don't run! The reason is that due to aberration, running will cause the rain to come in from  the  front,  thus  exposing  a  much  larger  area  of  the  body. 
别跑！原因是由于畸变，跑步会导致雨水从前方进入，从而暴露出更大的身体区域。
If  you  walk,  it'll mostly come from above, and only the shoulders and the head will get wet. 
如果你走路，雨主要是从上面浇，只有肩膀和头部会被淋湿。
If it's not windy, use an umbrella. 
如果不刮风，就用雨伞。
It might be unhandy or uncool, but not even the best `tex-materials  can  beat an  umbrella  for  breathability  in  this  situation. 
它可能不舒适或不酷，但在这种情况下，即使是最好的“tex”材质也无法在透气性方面胜过雨伞。
Don't  get one  of  those  fashionably  huge  umbrellas. 
别买那种时髦的大雨伞。
For  handiness,  the  smaller  the  better. 
为了方便起见，越小越好。
For  instance,  I  can  fit  my  telescopic  $5  umbrella  in  my  chest  pocket. 
例如，我可以把5美元的伸缩伞放在胸前的口袋里。
Even without an umbrella, it's possible to walk for about an hour and only get the top part of the jacket and maybe the shins of the pants wet. 
即使没有雨伞，也可以步行一个小时，只弄湿上衣的上部，可能还有裤子的小腿。

If it's rainy and windy, the problem becomes more difficult. 
如果下雨刮风，问题变得很困难了。
The umbrella is now  useless:  if  deployed,  it'll  blow  out  shortly. 
这把伞现在没用了：如果展开，它很快就会爆炸。
`Tex  shell  jackets  are  great. 
`Tex壳的夹克是最好的。
I prefer  the  three-layer  type  which  comprise  a  liner,  a  `tex  barrier,  and  the  outer shell,  which  is  typically  treated  with  water  repellent. 
我更喜欢三层结构，包括内衬、Tex功能层和外壳，外壳通常经过防水处理。
The  two-layer  jackets  are slightly  lighter,  slightly  more  expensive,  and,  I  suspect,  slightly  less  durable. 
双层夹克稍轻一些，稍贵一些，而且，我怀疑，稍不耐用。
They  use  a  special  treatment  on  the  `tex  layer  so  that  it  doesn't  need  to  be protected by a liner. 
他们在“tex”层上做了特殊处理，这样就不需要内衬保护。
I got my jacket about 14 years ago for around $400 or $500 and  it  was  completely  worth  it,  being  presently  amortized  to  about  $40/year. 
大约14年前，我花了400或500美元买了这件夹克，它完全值得，目前摊销到每年40美元左右。
Having an absolutely windproof and breathable jacket feels much better than an insulated  nylon  jacket. 
拥有一件绝对防风透气的夹克感觉比绝缘尼龙夹克要好得多。
If  the  outer  shell  is  waterproofed,  it's  sufficiently  water resistant to take a shower with. 
如果外壳是防水的，它足够防水，可以抵抗淋浴喷头。
If it's not, water in the soaked shell will slowly diffuse "around the corner" at the sleeves and creep up on the inside. 
如果不是这样的话，浸透的外壳里的水会在袖子的“角落”慢慢扩散，然后从里面爬上来。
Also, the `tex  will  no  longer  be  breathing,  although  it's  still  practically  waterproof. 
当然，tex将不再呼吸，尽管它实际上仍然防水。
I picked an all-black jacket, because it works better for business casual than signal colors--if that is not of concern to you, I would advise offshore foul weather gear because of its superior hood and collar. 
我选择了一件全黑色的夹克，因为它更适合商务休闲装，而不是信号色——如果你不担心这一点，我建议你选择海上恶劣天气装备，因为它的兜帽和领子都很好。
Two things to consider: First, a big hood- -check to see if it holds a bike helmet; a jacket designed for military use likely will--and  preferably  one  that  folds  into  the  collar  to  retain  the  business  casual feel. 
有两件事需要考虑：第一，一个大兜帽——检查它是否兼容自行车头盔；设计用于军事用途的夹克可能会——最好是能折叠到衣领中以保持商务休闲的感觉。
Most hoods on cheaper jackets are so small that buckling up means having the  hood  directly  on  your  skin. 
大多数便宜夹克上的兜帽都很小，扣起来就意味着兜帽直接贴在皮肤上。
A  good  hood  should  have  the  appearance  of  a small  astronaut  helmet. 
一个好的兜帽应该有一个小号宇航员头盔的外观。
Large  pockets  are  great. 
大口袋很好。
I  can  carry  one  umbrella,  two bananas, a large pair of gloves, or a handheld 2-meter transceiver in my inside pocket. 
我可以随身携带一把雨伞、两个香蕉、一双大手套，或者在我的内口袋里放一个2米长的手持式收发机。
It's  huge. 
它很大。
It  also  has  a  drawstring  to  adjust  the  waist  and  the  bottom. 
它还有一根可以调节腰部和底部的抽绳。
When it rains, the bottom should be wide. 
下雨时，底部应该是宽的。
If it's snug, water will just run onto the pants. 
如果贴身，水就会流到裤子上。
The waist doesn't matter in terms of rain. 
就雨水而言，腰围无关紧要。
Generally, if it's cold, the waist should be loose. 
一般来说，如果天气寒冷，腰部应该放松。
If it's warm, it doesn't matter. 
如果天气暖和，那没关系。
Most shells will have the option for a zip-in fleece. 
大多数硬壳都有内衬拉链。
Get a liner that fits the zipper. 
找一个适合拉链的衬里。
Often it doesn't have to be the same  brand,  as  long  as  it  fits. 
通常不必是同一品牌，只要合适就行。
Pants  are  much  less  important  than  one  might think. 
裤子没有人们想象的那么重要。
Unless  we're  talking  heavy  rain  under  windy  conditions,  jeans  are perfectly  alright. 
除非我们说的是大风天气下的大雨，否则牛仔裤完全没问题。
Remember,  when  walking,  rain  comes  mainly  from  above. 
记住，行走时，雨水主要来自上方。
Therefore, cheap rain pants will do. 
因此，便宜的雨裤就可以了。
The problem here is that moisture from the inside will get your pants wet anyway. 
这里的问题是，内部的湿气无论如何都会弄湿你的裤子。
Therefore I often prefer to wear a loose set of pants on top of my regular pants. 
因此，我通常更喜欢在普通裤子的上面穿一套宽松的裤子。
Jogging pants work fine for this. 
慢跑裤适合这个。
They do get  wet,  but  since  they  are  loose,  the  water  doesn't  transfer  to  the  layer  below. 
它们确实会被弄湿，但由于它们是宽散的，水不会转移到下面的一层。
One  important  point  is  not  to  tuck  the  pants  legs  into  the  boots  or  socks. 
重要的一点是不要把裤腿塞进靴子或袜子里。
The bottom of the pants will get wet and transfer to whatever they touch. 
裤子的底部会被弄湿，并转移到他们接触到的任何东西上。

Depending on the level of flooding, hiking boots are recommended. 
根据过水的程度，建议穿登山靴。
If you're walking regularly, I'd get a pair anyway. 
如果你经常散步，我建议还是买一双的。
Personally, the quality I demand doesn't cost less than $200. 
就我个人而言，我要求的质量不低于200美元。
The cheaper ones only last a couple thousand miles before the seams start breaking. 
更便宜的只有几千公里的寿命，接缝就开始断裂。
My current pair of boots are almost as old as my jacket and  I've  walked  many  thousands  of  miles  in  them. 
我现在的那双靴子几乎和我的夹克一样旧，我穿着它走了几千公里。
This  means  an  annual depreciation cost of about $20, if maintenance is expensed separately. 
这意味着，如果维修费用单独支出，每年的折旧成本约为20美元。
They are full grain leather. 
它们是全粒面皮革。
I don't like nubuck because it doesn't last as long and it doesn't survive  long  against  rock,  in  the  case  of  serious  hiking. 
我不喜欢牛磨砂，因为它寿命没有那么久，而且在严苛的徒步旅行中，它也不能在岩石上幸存。
It  goes  without  saying that I'd never get anything with nylon in it. 
不用说，我永远不会获取任何含有尼龙的东西。
My boots have a stitched Norwegian welt. 
我的靴子有一条缝好的挪威边。
Stitched  welts  are  getting  hard  to  find  these  days  since  $100  glued  sole boots sell better, but some companies still make them. 
由于售价100美元的胶合鞋底靴卖得更好，缝合的贴边越来越难找到，但一些公司仍在生产。
If you get a chance to buy a  pair,  jump  on  it--maybe  buy  two  or  three  pairs  so  you're  covered  for  life! Having used a lot of leather fat and polish, I've made mine quite water-resistant and wouldn't think twice about walking through a two inch deep water puddle. 
如果你有机会买一双，那就去买吧——也许买两三双，这样你就可以终身受保了！ 使用了大量的皮革油脂和上光剂，我已经使我的皮革非常防水，并且在穿过五厘米深的水坑时不会犹豫。
Find a good cobbler who will put in good replacement soles, preferably the same as  the  original  soles  or  better,  rather  than  a  cheap  sole  that  has  to  be  replaced again in a year. 
找一个好的鞋匠，他会换上好的鞋底，最好和原来的鞋底一样或更好，而不是一年内必须更换的便宜鞋底。

This outfit should work for most situations. 
这套着装应该适用于大多数情况。
If you walk a lot or commute by foot, it works very well in cold/wet temperate climates. 
如果你经常步行或步行上下班，它在寒冷/潮湿的温带气候下非常有效。
So if such a climate is in your  future,  start  substituting  into  them  the  next  time  a  garment  or  some footwear breaks down.
因此，如果你的未来会出现这样的气候，那么下次一件衣服或一些鞋子坏了，就开始替换它们。
