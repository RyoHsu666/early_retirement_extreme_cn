To  a  large  extent,  weather  is  all  about  attitude  and  the  right  clothes  and shoes. 

I  grew  up  in  a  place  where  it  probably  rains  200  days  a  year,  and consequently I have more than a handful of different words for different types of rain. 

Conversely, a few raindrops in a dry area send people scrambling for cover. 

Similarly, one inch of snow in a place where it never snows sends cars careening all  over  the  place. 

Getting  caught  in  the  rain is  really  like  a  bear  attack. 

Don't run! The reason is that due to aberration, running will cause the rain to come in from  the  front,  thus  exposing  a  much  larger  area  of  the  body. 

If  you  walk,  it'll mostly come from above, and only the shoulders and the head will get wet. 

If it's not windy, use an umbrella. 

It might be unhandy or uncool, but not even the best `tex-materials  can  beat an  umbrella  for  breathability  in  this  situation. 

Don't  get one  of  those  fashionably  huge  umbrellas. 

For  handiness,  the  smaller  the  better. 

For  instance,  I  can  fit  my  telescopic  $5  umbrella  in  my  chest  pocket. 

Even without an umbrella, it's possible to walk for about an hour and only get the top part of the jacket and maybe the shins of the pants wet. 


If it's rainy and windy, the problem becomes more difficult. 

The umbrella is now  useless:  if  deployed,  it'll  blow  out  shortly. 

`Tex  shell  jackets  are  great. 

I prefer  the  three-layer  type  which  comprise  a  liner,  a  `tex  barrier,  and  the  outer shell,  which  is  typically  treated  with  water  repellent. 

The  two-layer  jackets  are slightly  lighter,  slightly  more  expensive,  and,  I  suspect,  slightly  less  durable. 

They  use  a  special  treatment  on  the  `tex  layer  so  that  it  doesn't  need  to  be protected by a liner. 

I got my jacket about 14 years ago for around $400 or $500 and  it  was  completely  worth  it,  being  presently  amortized  to  about  $40/year. 

Having an absolutely windproof and breathable jacket feels much better than an insulated  nylon  jacket. 

If  the  outer  shell  is  waterproofed,  it's  sufficiently  water resistant to take a shower with. 

If it's not, water in the soaked shell will slowly diffuse "around the corner" at the sleeves and creep up on the inside. 

Also, the `tex  will  no  longer  be  breathing,  although  it's  still  practically  waterproof. 

I picked an all-black jacket, because it works better for business casual than signal colors--if that is not of concern to you, I would advise offshore foul weather gear because of its superior hood and collar. 

Two things to consider: First, a big hood- -check to see if it holds a bike helmet; a jacket designed for military use likely will--and  preferably  one  that  folds  into  the  collar  to  retain  the  business  casual feel. 

Most hoods on cheaper jackets are so small that buckling up means having the  hood  directly  on  your  skin. 

A  good  hood  should  have  the  appearance  of  a small  astronaut  helmet. 

Large  pockets  are  great. 

I  can  carry  one  umbrella,  two bananas, a large pair of gloves, or a handheld 2-meter transceiver in my inside pocket. 

It's  huge. 

It  also  has  a  drawstring  to  adjust  the  waist  and  the  bottom. 

When it rains, the bottom should be wide. 

If it's snug, water will just run onto the pants. 

The waist doesn't matter in terms of rain. 

Generally, if it's cold, the waist should be loose. 

If it's warm, it doesn't matter. 

Most shells will have the option for a zip-in fleece. 

Get a liner that fits the zipper. 

Often it doesn't have to be the same  brand,  as  long  as  it  fits. 

Pants  are  much  less  important  than  one  might think. 

Unless  we're  talking  heavy  rain  under  windy  conditions,  jeans  are perfectly  alright. 

Remember,  when  walking,  rain  comes  mainly  from  above. 

Therefore, cheap rain pants will do. 

The problem here is that moisture from the inside will get your pants wet anyway. 

Therefore I often prefer to wear a loose set of pants on top of my regular pants. 

Jogging pants work fine for this. 

They do get  wet,  but  since  they  are  loose,  the  water  doesn't  transfer  to  the  layer  below. 

One  important  point  is  not  to  tuck  the  pants  legs  into  the  boots  or  socks. 

The bottom of the pants will get wet and transfer to whatever they touch. 


Depending on the level of flooding, hiking boots are recommended. 

If you're walking regularly, I'd get a pair anyway. 

Personally, the quality I demand doesn't cost less than $200. 

The cheaper ones only last a couple thousand miles before the seams start breaking. 

My current pair of boots are almost as old as my jacket and  I've  walked  many  thousands  of  miles  in  them. 

This  means  an  annual depreciation cost of about $20, if maintenance is expensed separately. 

They are full grain leather. 

I don't like nubuck because it doesn't last as long and it doesn't survive  long  against  rock,  in  the  case  of  serious  hiking. 

It  goes  without  saying that I'd never get anything with nylon in it. 

My boots have a stitched Norwegian welt. 

Stitched  welts  are  getting  hard  to  find  these  days  since  $100  glued  sole boots sell better, but some companies still make them. 

If you get a chance to buy a  pair,  jump  on  it--maybe  buy  two  or  three  pairs  so  you're  covered  for  life! Having used a lot of leather fat and polish, I've made mine quite water-resistant and wouldn't think twice about walking through a two inch deep water puddle. 

Find a good cobbler who will put in good replacement soles, preferably the same as  the  original  soles  or  better,  rather  than  a  cheap  sole  that  has  to  be  replaced again in a year. 


This outfit should work for most situations. 

If you walk a lot or commute by foot, it works very well in cold/wet temperate climates. 

So if such a climate is in your  future,  start  substituting  into  them  the  next  time  a  garment  or  some footwear breaks down.
