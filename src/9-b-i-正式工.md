Salaried work provides a very predictable money stream and typically a very predictable  work  schedule,  involving  showing  up  every  weekday  except  for about 10-25 days each year.
正式工作提供了一个非常可预测的资金流，通常是一个非常可预测的工作时间表，包括每个工作日签到，每年大约10-25天的休息。

A salary is paid when productivity is hard to measure because the effort can't be directly associated with a specific revenue-generating product or service.
当工作效率难以衡量时，就会支付工资，因为工作不能直接与特定的创收产品或服务相关联。
This means  that  productivity has  little  bearing  on  how  much  a  person  actually  gets paid,  salary  being  determined  by  contract  negotiation  skills  and  historical accidents, such as being hired the year before new hires are given a substantially higher  starting  salary.
这意味着生产率与一个人实际获得的工资几乎没有关系，工资由合同谈判技巧和历史事件决定，比如前一年被雇佣的新员工起薪高得多的。
It  may  be  that  this  is  what  has  led  to  the  widespread secrecy  about  what  coworkers  are  paid.
也许正是这一点导致了广泛的同事间薪酬的保密。
Such  secrecy  maintains  order,  because although managers may not be aware of how hard their people work, everybody knows, or rather has an opinion about how productive their coworkers really are.
这种保密可以维持秩序，因为尽管管理者可能不知道他们的员工工作有多努力，但每个人都知道，或者更确切地说，他们对同事的工作效率有自己的看法。
Piecework is often salaried because it's cheaper for an employee to train one full- time  employee  than  it  is  to  train  two  half-time  employees.
计件工作通常是正式的，因为一名员工培训一名全职员工比培训两名兼职员工要便宜。
The  systemic consequence is  unemployment  and thus competition for  full-time  jobs  (see Job Competition),  which  drives  salaries  down.
系统性后果是失业，从而导致全职工作的竞争（见[工作竞争]()），从而导致工资下降。
Conversely,  it  also  creates  more  job security with a given employer, since hourly paid workers are the first to be laid off  during  downturns.
相反，它也为特定雇主创造了更多的工作保障，因为小时工是经济低迷时期第一个被解雇的人。
Even  if  a  salaried  job  does  not  involve  piecework,  it's often expected for employees to be present regardless of whether they're being productive or not.
即使正式工作不涉及计件工作，人们通常也希望员工在场，不管他们是否有生产力。
This often leads to water cooler talk for hours, pretend work, and  other  nonproductive  activities,  which  many  people  actually  enjoy.
这通常会导致人们在冷水机上聊上几个小时，假装工作，以及其他一些非生产性的活动，而这正是许多人真正喜欢的。
The preponderance  of  this  is  of  course  company-dependent,  but  seems  somewhat proportional  to  the  size  of  the  company  and  the  amount  of  bureaucratic procedure.
这一优势当然取决于公司，但似乎与公司的规模和官僚程序的数量成正比。
But  I  don't  think  it's  inaccurate  to  suggest  that  the  atmosphere  is much like high school or college.
但我不认为认为这种气氛很像高中或大学的说法是不准确的。

However, being paid on salary can lead to less satisfaction since the effort- reward  connection  is  broken  when  the  employee  realizes  that  he  gets  paid  the same amount regardless of how much or how little he works.
然而，由于员工意识到无论工作多少，他都能得到相同的报酬，因此努力与回报之间的联系就被打破了，因此按工资支付报酬可能会导致满意度降低。
Realizing that pay often has more to do with negotiation skills, politics, or tenure than productivity or  even  responsibility  can  be  depressing.
意识到薪酬往往更多地与谈判技巧、政治或任期有关，而不是生产力甚至责任感，这可能会令人沮丧。
It  divides  the  workforce  into  three kinds  of  people,  popularly  known  as  work  horses,  show  horses,  and  horses' asses.
它将劳动力分为三类，通常被称为工作马、表演马和崽种马。
In  particular,  some  will  realize  that  they  can  get  further  ahead  through office  politics  and  career  management  than  conscientious  work,  some  will realize that showing up and doing the minimum amount of work will pay equally well, and some will not realize either one.
特别是，一些人会意识到，通过办公室政治和职业管理，他们可以比认真工作取得更大的进步，一些人会意识到，出现在办公室并做最低限度的工作会获得同样好的报酬，而一些人则不会看到这两点。
I'll let you guess which horse is which.
我让你猜猜哪匹马是哪匹。

Traditionally,  salaried  work  entails  some  form  of  continuous  career  where breaks  are  frowned  upon.
传统上，正式工作需要某种形式的连续职业，不允许休息。
Furthermore,  it'll  be  very  hard  to  negotiate  leaves  of several  weeks  to  take  vacations  or  work  on  other  things.
此外，要协商几周的假期来度假或做其他事情是非常困难的。
There  may  be noncompete  agreements  to  sign  or  other  kinds  of  golden  handcuffs  and behavioral restrictions.
可能会有竞业禁止协议要签署，或其他种类的金手铐和行为限制。

For these reasons, and because it tends to pay well due to the large number of hours worked, salaried work is the preferred method for accumulating a fund for financial  independence  (see  Financial  independence  and  investing).
由于这些原因，而且由于工作时间长，薪酬往往很高，因此正式工作是积累财务独立基金的首选方法（参见[财务独立和投资]()）。
There's plenty of advice out there, the most important piece of which is, in my opinion, to  pursue  something  you're  good  at  rather  than  something  you're  passionate about--these  are  not  necessarily  the  same  thing--and  consider  the  typical placement rates (unemployment levels), and in particular the cost of any kind of educational requirement, using either a discounted cash flow or  internal  rate of return analysis to see if it's worthwhile.
这里有很多的建议，在我看来，最重要的一点是去追求你擅长的东西，而不是你热衷的东西——这些不一定是一样的东西，而且考虑典型的安置率（失业率），尤其是任何教育需求的成本，使用贴现现金流或内部收益率分析来确定是否值得。
