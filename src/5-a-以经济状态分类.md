The two degrees of freedom in this figure describe four different types. 

I call these the salary man, the working man, the businessman, and the Renaissance man. 

In most cases a person will identify with aspects of all four, yet a person's behavioral  habits  from  one  type  tend  to  dominate  those  of  the  other  three, allowing us to classify any person as one of four types. 

The  totality  of  all  people  forms  an  ecosystem  or  a  culture  of  four interdependent types of differently behaving and differently thinking kinds of humans. 

Each type of human tends to fill a different niche of society. 

In different periods, different types will dominate the culture. 

The nondominant types will be considered undesirable or unrealistic, whereas the dominant type will generally be  considered  the  "right"  way  of  doing  things  and,  soon,  "The  way  we  have always done it." People of the dominant type effectively characterize the culture and  will  justify  their  actions  saying,  "Everybody  likes  to..."  or  "All  normal people  like  to..."  Those  living  differently  will  be  questioned,  "What  would happen to the present institutions of society if everybody started behaving like you do?" For example, the alarmed economist questions what would happen to the economy if everybody stopped consuming and started living on a quarter of what they used to. 

The answer is simple: The economy would be different. 

Some institutions would vanish and others would form (see Succession and the cycle of change and Breaking out).
