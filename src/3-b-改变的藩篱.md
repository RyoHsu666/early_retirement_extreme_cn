To change, many barriers must be overcome. 
要改变，必须克服许多障碍。

Having previously overcome barriers, overcoming new barriers becomes much easier. 
以前克服过障碍，克服新的障碍就变得容易得多。

You may want to cross-train for a new lifestyle by first completing a marathon, a PhD, or something equally  arduous,  like  building  a  house  of  cards. 
你可能希望通过首先完成马拉松、博士学位或同样艰巨的任务（例如建造纸牌屋）来交叉训练以适应新的生活方式。

 The  decision  to  overcome barriers  can  also  follow  from  shocking  events. 
克服障碍的决定，也可能源于令人震惊的事件。

 For  instance,  many  decide  to become healthy after they, or someone close to them, experiences their first heart attack or something equally serious. 
例如，许多人在自己或亲近的人经历了第一次心脏病发作，或同样严重的事情后，决定变得健康。

Similar epiphanies occur after temporary job losses during an economic crisis.
类似的顿悟发生在经济危机期间的失业之后。

Barriers include not knowing about an activity or its benefits, the belief that the activity is difficult to engage in, social disapproval, or the belief that there are  more  benefits  in  continuing  the  present  behavior. 
障碍包括：不知道某项活动或其好处、认为该活动难以从事、社会不赞成或相信继续当前行为有更多好处。

 People  will  naturally choose  activities  that  they  believe  to  have  high  benefits  and  low  barriers  to entry--the quick and easy way to riches. 
人们自然会选择他们认为收益高、进入门槛低的活动——快速而简单的致富方式。

Benefits and barriers vary significantly between people. 
人与人之间的利益和障碍差异很大。

To some, walking half a mile is fun, or at least as natural as putting on a pair of pants, whereas to others it represents a significant labor to be avoided. 
对一些人来说，步行半英里很有趣，或者至少就像穿上一条裤子一样自然，而对另一些人来说，它代表着需要避免的重体力劳动。

 Some  have  the  same  aversion  to  merely  getting  up  from  the  couch.
有些人同样厌恶仅仅是从沙发上爬起来。

Most importantly, the proposed behavior may compete with one or more other behaviors,  where  doing  the  proposed  activity  excludes  another  activity,  or  is simply believed to exclude another activity.
最重要的是，提议的行为可能会与一个或多个其他行为竞争，在这种情况下，提议的活动排除了另一项活动，或者只是被认为排除了另一项活动。

It'll often be the case that activities associated with the highest benefit, such as moving into a smaller home or giving up personal car ownership, also have the  highest  perceived  barriers. 
通常情况下，与最高利益相关的活动，例如搬入较小的房屋或放弃个人汽车所有权，也具有最高的感知障碍。

 In  addition,  choosing  these  activities  means rejecting other activities, such as driving out to get a bottle of shampoo because you  forgot  to  buy  it  earlier  this  morning  and  simply  "need"  it  for  tomorrow morning. 
此外，选择一些活动意味着拒绝其他活动，例如开车出去买一瓶洗发水，是因为你今天早上忘了买，而明天早上又“需要”它。

 Living  in  a  small  home  means  rejecting  the  pleasure  of  filling  up rooms with stuff from the mall. 
住在小房子里意味着，拒绝用商场里的东西填满房间的乐趣。

Not surprisingly, the most common reaction I get is,  "This  sounds  a  bit  extreme,"  or,  "This  may  be  fine  for  you,  but  I  prefer something that is more akin to what I'm currently doing."
毫不奇怪，我得到的最常见的反应是，“这听起来有点极端”，或者，“这对你来说可能没问题，但我更喜欢做和目前相似的事情。”


Hence, to convince you of something, I either have to convince you of the benefits of the proposed behavior (see Foundations of economics and finance).
因此，为了让你相信某事，我必须让你相信所提议行为的好处（见[经济和金融基础]()）。

the  surmountability  of  the  barriers  to  the  proposed  behavior  (see  A renaissance lifestyle).
所提议行为的障碍的可克服性（见[文艺复兴式生活方式]()）。


the marginal benefits of the competing behavior (see The lock-in)
竞争行为的边际收益（见[锁住]()）。

the foolhardiness of the barriers to the competing behavior (see The lock- in).
竞争行为障碍的鲁莽性（见[锁住]()）。

Many  people  associate  their  ideas  and  thoughts  with  who  they  are  as  a person. 
许多人将他们的观点和想法，与他们的个人身份联系起来。

This is a significant barrier, since admitting that an alternative is better is perceived as a personal failure. 
这是一个重大的障碍，因为承认替代方案更好会被视为是个人失败。

Barriers are therefore raised to protect the ego and  avoid  a  change  of  perceptions. 
因此，障碍被提高以保护自我，并避免观念的改变。

 This  is  done  by  adopting  one  of  the counterstrategies to the list above. 
这是通过对上述列表采用适应性对策来完成的。

The most common counter-arguments are that the barriers to the proposed behavior are too high: "I can't give up my car."
最常见的反驳意见是，提议行为的障碍太高：“我不能放弃我的车。”

 The second most common counter arguments are that the benefits of the proposed behavior are too low: "I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have to go to work all day every day."
第二个最常见的反驳论点是，所提议行为的好处太低：“如果我不用每天整天上班，我不知道我会做什么。”

 The third most common is that the barriers to the competing  behavior are low enough: "I'm already doing it this way--I got too much invested already."
第三个最常见的是，竞争行为的障碍足够低：“我已经在这样做了——我已经投入太多了。”

 The fourth most common is that the benefits of the competing behavior are sufficiently high: "Although I'm miserable, at least I'm comfortable."
第四个最常见的是，竞争行为的好处足够高：“虽然我很痛苦，但至少我很舒服。”

 This varies depending on who you are.
Barriers represent a cost which must be paid. 
这取决于你是谁。
障碍代表必须支付的成本。

The willingness to pay depends on a combination of dissatisfaction with the present situation, vision of the future situation, and the practicality of changing from the present situation to the future situation. 
支付意愿取决于对现状的不满、对未来形势的展望，以及从现状转变为未来形势的实用性。

This will to change can be represented by the volume of the pyramid in the figure.
这种改变的意愿可以用[图]()中金字塔的体积来表示。

![figure1](../img/figure1.png)

The volume of the pyramid represents the will to change from an unsatisfying situation to something else and depends on vision, how practical the change is, and the level of dissatisfaction with the situation. 
金字塔的体积代表，从不满意的情况改变为其他情况的意愿，这取决于愿景、改变的实际程度，以及对情况的不满程度。

Intuitively speaking, if either dissatisfaction, vision, or practical first steps are lacking, it's unlikely that action will be taken. 
直观地说，如果缺乏不满、远见或实际的第一步，就不太可能采取行动。

Specifically: If dissatisfaction is low, obviously no change is going to happen. 
具体来说：如果不满意程度很低，显然不会发生任何变化。


Why change strategy if you're satisfied with the way things are?
如果你对现状感到满意，为什么要改变策略？

If vision is low, this can lead to a situation of comfortable misery where the vision  isn't  strong  enough  or  too  scary  to  allow  change. 
如果愿景很低，这会导致一种舒适的痛苦，即愿景不够强或太害怕而不允许改变。


 A  high  level  of dissatisfaction can be accompanied by low vision in cases of depression, loss of faith or vision, or by external circumstances. 
在抑郁、信仰或愿景丧失、外部环境下，高度的不满可能同时伴随着愿景的低下。

For example, the mistake many make when becoming frugal is that they don't replace their previous vision of accumulating more stuff with an equally strong vision of doing something else.
例如，许多人在节俭时犯的错误是，他们以前积累东西的强烈愿景，没有用于做其他事情。

Giving up the current vision thus results in feelings of deprivation, and is, in a sense, a loss of faith and even identity. 
因此，放弃当前的愿景会导致被剥夺的感觉，或从某种意义上说，是一种信仰甚至身份的丧失。

If, however, you follow a different faith than "the Church of Shopping," then not partaking in the shopping ritual won't be a deprivation.
但是，如果你遵循与“购物教会”不同的信仰，那么不参与购物仪式就不会被剥夺。

Dissatisfaction with the current situation may be high and the vision of an alternative  may  be  high  as  well,  but  without  a  plan,  this  can  only  lead  to frustration. 
对现状的不满可能很高，对替代方案的愿景也可能很高，但如果没有计划，这只会导致沮丧。

There must be a strategy or at least a plan, and it must be practical.
To get things done, it's much better to have a plan than to have passion, at least insofar as you act on it.
必须有策略或至少有计划，而且必须切实可行。
为了把事情做好，有计划比有激情要好得多，至少在你付诸行动的时候是这样。

Finally, there is the issue of perceived cost. 
If the cost is too high, change is not going to happen.
最后，还有感知成本的问题。
如果成本太高，改变就不会发生。

Changemongers thus have the following four variables to play with:
1. Increase your dissatisfaction with present situation.
2.  Strengthen your vision of future situation.
3.  Build a plan to get from the present to the future.
4.  Lower the perceived cost of the plan.
因此，变化兜售者有以下四个变量可供使用：
1. 增加你对现状的不满。
2. 加强对未来形势的展望。
3. 制定一个从现在到未来的计划。
4. 降低计划的感知成本。


Motivation depends  on  the  individual  too. 
动机也取决于个人。

 For  instance,  I'm  motivated  by avoiding  negative  outcomes  such  as  feeling  bad. 
例如，我的动机是避免负面结果，例如感觉不好。

 Others  are  motivated  by striving for positive outcomes such as feeling good. 
其他人则是通过努力获得积极的结果，例如感觉良好的激励。

I prefer to change instantly and  radically. 
我更喜欢立即的、根本上的改变。

 Others  prefer  to  change  slowly. 
其他人则喜欢慢慢改变。

 I  have  written  many  of  the suggestions  in  the  following  chapters  in  the  spirit  of  changing  away  from something negative immediately. 
本着立即摆脱消极事物的精神，我在接下来的章节中写了许多建议。

If you feel differently about change, modify my approach to suit your personality accordingly
如果您对改变有不同的看法，请相应地修改我的方法以适合你的个性。
