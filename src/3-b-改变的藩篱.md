To change, many barriers must be overcome. Having previously overcome
barriers, overcoming new barriers becomes much easier. You may want to cross-
train for a new lifestyle by first completing a marathon, a PhD, or something
equally  arduous,  like  building  a  house  of  cards.  The  decision  to  overcome
barriers  can  also  follow  from  shocking  events.  For  instance,  many  decide  to
become healthy after they, or someone close to them, experiences their first heart
attack or something equally serious. Similar epiphanies occur after temporary
job losses during an economic crisis.
Barriers include not knowing about an activity or its benefits, the belief that
the activity is difficult to engage in, social disapproval, or the belief that there
are  more  benefits  in  continuing  the  present  behavior.  People  will  naturally
choose  activities  that  they  believe  to  have  high  benefits  and  low  barriers  to
entry--the quick and easy way to riches. Benefits and barriers vary significantly
between people. To some, walking half a mile is fun, or at least as natural as
putting on a pair of pants, whereas to others it represents a significant labor to be
avoided.  Some  have  the  same  aversion  to  merely  getting  up  from  the  couch.
Most importantly, the proposed behavior may compete with one or more other
behaviors,  where  doing  the  proposed  activity  excludes  another  activity,  or  is
simply believed to exclude another activity.
It'll often be the case that activities associated with the highest benefit, such
as moving into a smaller home or giving up personal car ownership, also have
the  highest  perceived  barriers.  In  addition,  choosing  these  activities  means
rejecting other activities, such as driving out to get a bottle of shampoo because
you  forgot  to  buy  it  earlier  this  morning  and  simply  "need"  it  for  tomorrow
morning.  Living  in  a  small  home  means  rejecting  the  pleasure  of  filling  up
rooms with stuff from the mall. Not surprisingly, the most common reaction I get
is,  "This  sounds  a  bit  extreme,"  or,  "This  may  be  fine  for  you,  but  I  prefer
something that is more akin to what I'm currently doing."
Hence, to convince you of something, I either have to convince you of
the benefits of the proposed behavior (see Foundations of economics and
finance).
the  surmountability  of  the  barriers  to  the  proposed  behavior  (see  A
renaissance lifestyle).
the marginal benefits of the competing behavior (see The lock-in)

the foolhardiness of the barriers to the competing behavior (see The lock-
in).

Many  people  associate  their  ideas  and  thoughts  with  who  they  are  as  a
person. This is a significant barrier, since admitting that an alternative is better is
perceived as a personal failure. Barriers are therefore raised to protect the ego
and  avoid  a  change  of  perceptions.  This  is  done  by  adopting  one  of  the
counterstrategies to the list above. The most common counter-arguments are that
the barriers to the proposed behavior are too high: "I can't give up my car." The
second most common counter arguments are that the benefits of the proposed
behavior are too low: "I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have to go to work all
day every day." The third most common is that the barriers to the competing
behavior are low enough: "I'm already doing it this way--I got too much invested
already." The fourth most common is that the benefits of the competing behavior
are sufficiently high: "Although I'm miserable, at least I'm comfortable." This
varies depending on who you are.
Barriers represent a cost which must be paid. The willingness to pay depends
on a combination of dissatisfaction with the present situation, vision of the future
situation, and the practicality of changing from the present situation to the future
situation. This will to change can be represented by the volume of the pyramid in
the figure.

The volume of the pyramid represents the will to change from an
unsatisfying situation to something else and depends on vision, how
practical the change is, and the level of dissatisfaction with the situation.
Intuitively speaking, if either dissatisfaction, vision, or practical first steps
are lacking, it's unlikely that action will be taken. Specifically: If dissatisfaction
is low, obviously no change is going to happen. Why change strategy if you're

satisfied with the way things are?
If vision is low, this can lead to a situation of comfortable misery where the
vision  isn't  strong  enough  or  too  scary  to  allow  change.  A  high  level  of
dissatisfaction can be accompanied by low vision in cases of depression, loss of
faith or vision, or by external circumstances. For example, the mistake many
make when becoming frugal is that they don't replace their previous vision of
accumulating more stuff with an equally strong vision of doing something else.
Giving up the current vision thus results in feelings of deprivation, and is, in a
sense, a loss of faith and even identity. If, however, you follow a different faith
than "the Church of Shopping," then not partaking in the shopping ritual won't
be a deprivation.
Dissatisfaction with the current situation may be high and the vision of an
alternative  may  be  high  as  well,  but  without  a  plan,  this  can  only  lead  to
frustration. There must be a strategy or at least a plan, and it must be practical.
To get things done, it's much better to have a plan than to have passion, at least
insofar as you act on it.
Finally, there is the issue of perceived cost. If the cost is too high, change is
not going to happen.
Changemongers thus have the following four variables to play with:
1.  Increase your dissatisfaction with present situation.
2.  Strengthen your vision of future situation.
3.  Build a plan to get from the present to the future.
4.  Lower the perceived cost of the plan.
Motivation depends  on  the  individual  too.  For  instance,  I'm  motivated  by
avoiding  negative  outcomes  such  as  feeling  bad.  Others  are  motivated  by
striving for positive outcomes such as feeling good. I prefer to change instantly
and  radically.  Others  prefer  to  change  slowly.  I  have  written  many  of  the
suggestions  in  the  following  chapters  in  the  spirit  of  changing  away  from
something negative immediately. If you feel differently about change, modify
my approach to suit your personality accordingly
