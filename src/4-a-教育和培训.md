Children naturally try to emulate their parents, at least in the early years,

parents have outsourced their  children's
upbringing and, possibly taking a lesson from their own situation as wage slaves,
they now act as managers of their children's lives and careers rather than as role
models, signing them up for extracurricular activities that are so very important
for their résumé to get into their dream college. What happened to spending all
day kicking a rock around or catching frogs in the creek? For that matter, what
happened to the frogs?7
Fortunately, most of the skills necessary for success as a consumer and wage
slave  are  taught  in  the  institutions  of  the  public  school  system.  It's  not  the
subjects that are taught so much as it's the way they're taught. During children's
typical  12-year  stint  in  the  public  school  system,  the  most  "successful"  (read
well-adjusted) learn not to question authority, not to ask questions which don't
pertain to the task at hand, to follow procedure, that trying is better than doing,
to be a team player, and not to stand out. Most importantly, children are trained
to  sit  still  for  increasingly  longer  time  spans  while  doing  mentally  menial
busywork. During recess children learn the importance of being well-liked and
fitting  in--that  is,  being  unique  and  special  within  a  certain  restricted  range.
These  are  the  essentials  for  later  success  on  the  job.  If  it  wasn't  for  this
behavioral training, the limited subject matter that is actually taught could be
accomplished much more quickly. However, imagine what would happen if 12-
year-olds with the same intellectual power as high school students, but without
the acquired discipline and dulled creativity to sit still and follow boring work
procedures for extended periods, suddenly flooded the job market. Would they
even want a job?
The mass education in high schools reflects the mass production of the real
world. The teaching style has one teacher (supervisor) lecturing (leading) 20-25
students  (workers)  sitting  in  rows,  much  like  a  manager  and  his  employees.
Practically  all  problems  that  are  presented  are  closed-form  problems  where
there's only one answer that, by construction, can be found using the methods in
the textbook. The subjects taught are selected to be testable, preferably using
standardized exams with predefined answers. This means that most subjects are
mechanical  rather  than  organic  in  nature,  in  the  sense  that  they  have  a  well-
defined  problem  with  an  easy,  step-by-step  method  of  arriving  at  a  solution,
rather than an open-ended problem with nonlinear and complex solutions. There
is therefore an advantage to focusing on memorizing the textbook rather than
attaining  a  broader  understanding.  This  is  excellent  training  for  intelligently
following  procedure,  but  also  a  powerful  counter-training  against  using
intelligence creatively.
The testing structure is fairly simple. Some chapter in the book will have a
paragraph which reads, "There are three known instances of..." while the test
will have a question, "Name the three instances of..." This is not much different
from a job, where there are three kinds of burgers for sale and the cash register
has three pictures of burgers (press the correct one), or three kinds of situations
with three different forms to fill out one for each. This kind of education doesn't
instill  much  permanent  information,  and  it  doesn't  require  much  deep
understanding of the fundamentals. It doesn't instill knowledge and it certainly
doesn't instill wisdom--in that sense, I guess it's much like the news media. What
it mostly does is to test the students' intelligence and short-term memorization
skills, and their willingness to use these talents to maximize their test scores and
grades. It's fortunate that most office jobs don't require much prior knowledge
from  the  job  applicant.  The  procedures  for  most  jobs  can  be  learned  by  a
sufficiently  intelligent  person  with  a  sufficiently  good  memory  and  the
conditioning to concentrate on the same task for long hours. Many employers,
however,  don't  hire  people  without  the  required  proof  of  achievement  and
conformity--that is, a degree.
Meanwhile,  many  subjects  that  could  be  taught  in  school  are  not.  It's
probably safe to say that adolescent children growing up in a "primitive" tribe
understand the world around them by the time they reach adulthood. They know
which plants are safe and which are poisonous. They can hunt and cook and they
know the real nutritional value of various foods. They can clothe themselves.
They know how to fix and even build a house. They know about sex and having
children.
On the other hand, people in our "advanced" civilization know practically
nothing about our world. Despite being wholly dependent on technology for all

our needs, few understand how technology provides us with light, heat, food,
communication, transportation, etc. All we know is how to turn on the ignition
and  press  a  button  so  technology  magically  performs  its  intended  function.
Despite their "education," students are still left to magical thinking and are thus
unable  to  understand  the  direct  causes  in  the  world  around  them.  Specific
functions are thus associated with specific (brand name) products rather than the
operating ingredients and construction of the product. It would never occur to
them that the majority of their collection of 20 different and highly advertised
cleaning products could all be replaced with the vinegar and baking soda which
people used to use. It would never occur to them to chop garlic with a knife
instead of using one of the many different designs of garlic press.
This  product-oriented  thinking  extends  to  health.  The  connection  between
lifestyle and health has been lost. The focus has moved from a healthy lifestyle
to affordable health insurance, making health a product rather than a state of
being. Cardiovascular problems resulting from stress and lack of exercise can be
solved by purchasing triple-bypass operations and popping specialized aspirins.
People have heart attacks because they don't see the connection to their stressful,
unhealthy lifestyles, and people die from heart attacks despite being surrounded
by bystanders because practically none of them knows CPR or basic first aid.
Critical  thinking  has  been  replaced  by  opinions  derived  from  pundits  and
political and religious leaders since people prefer having other people think for
them. World affairs are replaced with celebrity reporting, and satirical news is
often more analytical than real news.
In  conclusion,  after  "growing  up,"  the  only  thing  children  know  is  that
problems are solved by buying products; that in order to buy something, one
needs a job; and in order to get a job, one needs a college degree, which happens
to be considered a brand name product as well.
