In computing, actually high-tech in general, there are a number of consumers who effectively "pay" to be beta testers of companies' products in exchange for having  the  latest  and  greatest. 
在计算领域，实际上是一般的高科技领域，有许多消费者实际上“付费”成为公司产品的测试人员，以换取最新和最好的产品。
Leave  it  to  other  consumers  to  work  out  the technological  kinks  and  take  the  depreciation hit  for  "driving  it  off  the  lot."  If you  really  enjoy  being  at  the  cutting  edge,  be  a  reviewer,  a  tester,  or  even  a developer. 
把它留给其他消费者去解决技术难题，和“把它开出停车场”而承受贬值的打击。如果你真的喜欢站在最前沿，那就做一名评审员、测试人员，甚至是开发人员。

Similarly,  there  are  a  great  number  of  people  who  must  watch  movies  as soon as they come out or pay full price for CDs. 
同样地，也有很多人一出门就得看电影，或是付全价买CD。
Instead, lag the edge and watch movies at the dollar theater or wait for them be released on DVD--even better, wait  until  they  appear  in  the  library  or on  TV. 
相反，你可以在一美元剧院看电影，或者等电影DVD上发行——更好的是，等电影出现在图书馆或电视上。
You'll  see  "new"  movies  at  the latter  sources  as  well64--that  is,  they'll  be  new  to  you,  and  the  only  difference will be in lagging the movie theaters by one to two years; but you'll no longer be paying attention to that.Most curious is the phenomenon of the hyper-consumer, who effectively pays to continuously own new stuff, to avoid being seen sitting on  last  year's  furniture,  and  the  culture  that  goes  along  with  that. 
你也会在后面的来源看到“新”电影——也就是说，它们对你来说是新的，唯一的区别是比电影院落后一到两年；但你将不再关注这一点。最令人好奇的是超级消费者的现象，他们为了不被人看到坐在去年的家具上，而不断地花钱购买新东西。
The  hyper- consumer  has  to  get  rid  of  last  year's  stuff  somehow,  which  can  be  had  at  ex- depreciation costs for much less. 
超级消费者必须以某种方式处理掉去年的东西，这些东西可以以更低的折旧成本得到。
This also goes for store inventory that did not sell in time: Last year's model has to be discounted even though it's effectively the same as the current one, because who would want to buy last year's model at the same price? If I have to get something new, like rollerskates, I just get last year's  model. 
这也适用于没有及时售出的商店库存：去年的车型必须打折，尽管它实际上与当前车型相同，因为谁愿意以相同的价格购买去年的车型？如果我必须买一些新的东西，比如旱冰鞋，我只买去年的型号。
Last  year's  inventory  is  typically  cleared  at  certain  times  of  the year, so keep an eye out and be ready to pick it up; it goes fast!
去年的库存通常在一年中的某些时候清理完毕，所以要密切注意，随时准备领取；它跑得很快！
