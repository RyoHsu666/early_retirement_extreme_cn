The  most  important  purpose  of  education  isn't  getting  a  degree,  nor  is  it memorizing  a  collection  of  facts  in  order  to  win  on  quiz  shows. 
教育最重要的目的不是获得学位，也不是为了在智力竞赛节目中获胜，而记住一系列事实。
 Education  is supposed to transform and build the character, mind, and body of the students. 
教育应该转变和培养学生的性格、思想和身体。
The  point  of  an  education  is  to  learn  a  systematic  way  of  improving  those aspects--exercising, researching, and figuring things out to build a foundation for continued learning for the rest of one's life, so that one may live his life to the fullest  extent  possible. 
教育的意义在于学到一个系统的方法，来提高这些方面——锻炼，研究，并找出解决办法，为以后的生活建立持续的学习基础，使人们在生活里尽可能地展现可能性。
 Learning  must  become  a  habit  (see  Ergodicity  and destiny) that is applied to all aspects of life before it can be said that a person is truly an educated person. 
学习必须成为一种习惯（参见[遍历性和命运]()），并应用于生活的方方面面，这才能说一个人是真正受过教育的人。
This means that learning never stops. 
这意味着学习永远不会停止。
Sadly, this point is entirely missed by our current educational system, or at least by the students who consider education to be a product and who stop learning as soon as they get their degree. 
可悲的是，这一点完全被我们当前的教育体系所忽视，或者至少被那些，认为教育是一种产品的学生所忽视，他们一旦拿到学位就停止学习。

Education widens the focus while training narrows it. 
教育扩大了关注点，而培训缩小了关注点。

Training  teaches  skills  and  methods. 
培训教授技能和方法。
 Aside  from  training  in  research  and perhaps  one  vocation,  learning  more  skills  in  depth  isn't  important,  if  the methods  are  restricted  to  one  field  (see  The  cost  of  specialization  and  this figure). 
除了研究培训和一种职业培训之外，如果方法仅限于一个领域，那么深入学习更多技能并不重要（参见[专业化的代价]()和此[图]()）。
 Besides,  in  a  book  like  this,  it's  impossible  to  cover  all  the  skills  of Human  capital  and  necessary  personal  assets  in  detail. 
此外，在这样一本书中，不可能详细介绍人力资本的所有技能和必要的个人资产。
 This  would  be  training, and  it's  almost  guaranteed  that  specific  methods  are  going  to  be  incompatible with  the  needs  of  specific  readers,  given  all  our  individual  circumstances. 
这将是一种培训，考虑到我们的个人情况的不同，几乎可以保证特定的方法，一定不符合特定读者的需求。
 In addition,  training  creates  contentment  and  a  tendency  not  to  seek  answers outside traditional procedures. 
此外，培训带来了满足感，和不在传统程序之外寻求答案的倾向。
This is detrimental to you if you need to think for yourself,  but  a  benefit  to  you  if  you  need  others  to  think  for  you. 
如果你需要自我思考，这对你是有害的，但是如果你需要别人为你思考，这对你是有益的。
 Education never provides simple answers. 
教育从来不会提供简单的答案。
 Fundamental principles, concepts, or structures are  more  important  than  technique,  because  it  is  only  possible  to  understand structures in the world if one has formed a corresponding structure in the mind. 
基本原理、概念或结构比技术更重要，因为只有在头脑中形成了相应的结构，才能理解世界上的结构。
The  more  structures  the  mind  has  to  draw  on,  the  quicker  it  is  at  gaining  an understanding of other subjects, as well as synthesizing new information, as the neural  patterns  in  the  brain  are  already  in  place  (see  Economic  degrees  of freedom). 
大脑需要利用的结构越多，它就越能更快地理解其他学科，以及合成新信息，因为大脑中的神经模式已经就位（参见[经济上的自由度]()）。

For instance, in the sciences, a young, technically adept person will be able to  quickly  crunch  numbers  and  manipulate  equations,  while  perhaps  not  quite understanding  the  underlying  concepts  of  his  chosen  specialization,  whereas  a more  experienced  person  will  quickly  understand  the  underlying  concepts  of even  unfamiliar  subject  areas. 
例如，在科学领域，一个年轻、技术娴熟的人，将能够快速处理数字和操纵方程，而可能不太理解他所选择的专业的基本概念，而更有经验的人，会很快理的基本概念，甚至是不熟悉的学科领域的基本概念。
 In  physics  and  mathematics,  such  experienced people are said to have physical intuition or mathematical maturity, respectively. 
在物理学和数学方面，可以说，这些有经验的人具有物理直觉和数学成熟度。

Sadly,  many  educations  focus  more  on  technical  details  because  they  are more  easily  testable. 
可悲的是，许多教育更多地关注技术细节，因为它们更容易测试。
 Even  without  the  need  for  testing,  many  authors  and educators  are  guilty  of  obscuring  the  fundamentals  by  giving  equal  time  to  all pieces  of  information.33  Automatically  grasping  what  is  important  only  comes with experience. 
即使不需要测试，许多作者和教育者，也会因为给所有信息同等的时间，从而蒙蔽了基本原理而感到内疚。只有有了经验，才能自动掌握重要的东西。

Now, there are many ways of measuring experience, the most popular being tenure. 
现在，有很多衡量经验的方法，最流行的是任期。
 However,  working in  the  same place  for five years does not imply five years of experience. 
然而，在同一个地方工作五年，并不意味着有五年的经验。
If you've been doing exactly the same thing, day in and day out for five years, and it only took a day to learn, you have one day's experience, five years over. 
如果你五年来日复一日做着完全相同的事情，而只花了一天的时间就学会了，那么五年过去了，你有一天的经验。

People remember most of what they do, some of what they say, but little of what  they  see  or  hear.34  It's  therefore  important  to  do  things. 
人们记得他们所做的大部分事情，一些他们所说的，但很少记得他们所看到或听到的。因此，做很重要。
 You  must experiment  systematically  to  understand  the  underlying  fundamental  principle. 
你必须系统地进行实验，以了解基本原理。
In  cooking,  try  to  leave  ingredients  out  or  substitute  in  new  ones  to  see  what happens. 
烹饪时，试着省去配料或换上新的，看看会发生什么。
 In  sports,  practice  unmastered  techniques  actively  and  put  them together with other techniques. 
在体育运动中，积极练习未掌握的技术，并将其与其他技术结合起来。
In finance, try investing in different things. 
在金融领域，尝试投资不同的东西。
Don't be  afraid  to  try  new  things. 
不要害怕尝试新事物。
 Education  also  requires  being  open-minded. 
教育也需要思想开放。
 After learning a complicated subject, see if you can explain it to your mother35 or use it  in  an  otherwise  unrelated  field. 
在学习了一门复杂的学科后，看看你是否能向你的母亲解释一下，或者在其他不相关的领域中使用它。
 Only  after  doing  that  do  you  own  the knowledge.
 只有这样，你才能拥有知识。
