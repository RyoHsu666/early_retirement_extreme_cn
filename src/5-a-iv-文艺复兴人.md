A Renaissance man is a person who is competent in a wide range of fields, covering  intellectual  areas  as  well  as  the  arts,  physical  fitness,  and  social accomplishments.

This contrasts with the more modern, specialized approach, where a person is encouraged to build skills in a single vocation and use the income from that to pay for everything else.

However, I think it can be argued that a specialist is not a well-balanced human.

Many people strive for a sense a balance  between  work  and  life  without  ever  achieving  it,  leaving  some  areas underdeveloped  and  others  overly  so.

This  isn't  the  case  for  the  Renaissance man,  who  develops  all  sides  of  himself  to  their  full  potential.

Furthermore, generalized skills allow a Renaissance man to reach creative solutions for most of his needs.

Because of his ability to solve problems, the Renaissance man is  fairly independent of the marketplace since he no longer has to buy nearly as much  to  satisfy  his  needs.

Rather  than  buying  a  product,  he  puts  solutions together  using  social  skills  (borrowing,  bartering),  technical  skills  (building, reengineering),  artistic  skills  (designing,  creating),  and  physical  fitness (humanpowered  tools).

Buying  less  means  that  he  doesn't  require  millions  to reach financial independence.

For the money he needs, jobs are much easier to find.

The Renaissance man can apply for different jobs in different fields rather than just a single one.

Although they don't pay as well as a highly specialized career job, less money is needed.

Complex solutions based on multiple different skills don't require leverage.

They may result in profit, but profit is merely a side effect of the construction, and therefore the Renaissance man isn't subject to the same risk as the businessman.

The main purpose of the Renaissance man is to solve a problem as a human rather than as a part of the "work-spend" system.

The Renaissance man is capable of many different things and doesn't restrict himself  to  vocational  skills.

He  does  his  own  taxes  and  researches  his  own investments.

He can fix a computer or a broken appliance.

He knows how to drive and fix a car, but he has enough time and athletic ability to ride his bicycle 20 miles instead, or run five miles to get groceries.

Physically, he keeps up with people decades younger than himself.

He can play an instrument, dance, paint, or write creatively.

He can create interesting meals from scratch rather than recipe.

Socially, he knows who to ask for help, who needs help, and how to put people together to efficiently solve problems.

He is a leader or an inspiration to other people, whether it is personal, local, national, or global.

The Renaissance man has the best of all worlds.

In this figure, we can draw a line of increasing job dependence from the highly independent Renaissance man to the highly dependent salary man, with the working man and the businessman having a sort of semi-dependence.

Similarly, we can draw a line of increasing asset  independence  from  the  highly  independent  working  man  to  the  highly dependent businessman.

These dimensions are illustrated in this figure, which provides  another  way  of  looking  at  the  types.

This  can  be  thought  of  as  an alternative four types or a further splitting into octants to more precisely describe the leanings of a person.

In the latter case, each of the four types fall into a given wing.

The  nomenclature  of  the  figure  should  be  self-evident.

For  example,  a Renaissance man could be leaning towards asset-backed job independence of a businessman (Rb) or he could be leaning towards the jack-of-all-trades approach to job independence of a working man (Rw).

Similarly, the salary man could lean  towards  starting  a  side  business  or  investing  in  stocks  to  provide  more income to replace or add to some of his job income (Sb), or he could reduce his need for job income by divesting some of the things he has financed and finding  ways to do more and spend less (Sw).

A working man could engage in longer- term consulting projects (Ws).

An alternative way of looking at behaviors in terms of dependence on financing and having a job.

Taken together with the previous figure, this describes eight types.

Independence is not something one has; rather, it is something that one is.

This is good news, because it means that it is possible to change one's behavior and economic interactions in a way that fosters greater independence, or less, if so desired.

The salary man can work on reducing his dependence on money by learning and creating alternative solutions, thus reducing his dependence on a job.

Such activities are best started through one's hobbies.

Similarly, the working man can also learn to create solutions rather than buying them--in particular, it is quite  likely  that  the  working  man  will  already  be  creating  some  of  his  own solutions, like car repair, lawn maintenance, plumbing, etc.

This could free up money for his legacy or charity, or the money could simply be used to buy time for early retirement.

Finally, the businessman can discover other forms of profit than strictly monetary, like social and environmental.

Health and good relations could  just  as  easily  be  optimized,  and  when  business  size  is  subject  to diminishing returns, why not aim for a smaller but more efficient business (see Appropriate  response)?  That  is,  the  business  of  finding  solutions  for  just  a handful  of  people  rather  than  leveraged  solutions  that  control  and  serve thousands or millions of people.

Doing this, the businessman will find that the  leveraged bond eventually eases and money will flow to him freely.
