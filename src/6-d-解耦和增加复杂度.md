Complexity  provides  an  advantage  over  simplicity  because  of  its  greater
functionality.

由于更好的功能性，复杂优于简单。

 To wit, more is possible using a set of tools compared to a single
tool. 

即，更多是使用一套工具而不是一个工具。

 Complexity  allows  understanding/manipulating/using  the  same  thing  in
many  ways,  which  is  useful  for  perspective,  and
understanding/manipulating/using many things in the same way, which is useful
for synthesis (by  using  analogous  methods).  

复杂性允许以不同的方式理解、操作、使用相同的东西，这在洞察力上是有用的；并且还能以相同的方式理解、操作、使用很多东西，这在综合力上是有用的（通过使用比拟的方法）。

Complexity,  therefore,  results  in
flexibility.  

复杂性，也就是说，结果是灵活性。

Increasing  complexity  always  increases  capability  and  adaptability.

增加复杂性通常也增加兼容性和适应性。

The human species is probably the best example of this. 

人类就是最好的例子。

Humans have the most
complex  brains  of  all  species,  and  as  a  result,  we've  become  the  dominant
species and been able to adapt to practically all parts of the Earth.

人类有所以物种里最复杂的大脑，作为结果，我们成了压倒性的物种能够适应地球上的任何部分。

However, complexity also has a cost because maintaining increasing levels
of complexity requires increasingly more effort.

然而，复杂性也增加了消耗，因为增加复杂性也要求增加更多的精力。

 For instance, the human brain
uses an enormous amount of energy relative to the size of the body it controls
compared  to  other  mammals.  This  implies  that  there  is  an  optimal  point  of
functionality  where  the  efficiency--that  is,  the  ratio  of  functionality  to
maintenance  and  storage  cost--peaks.  The  purpose  of  education,  living,
interacting, and growing as a person should be to increase complexity--that is, to
progress through the stages from copying to creating as described in Gauging
mastery.  Without  this  progression,  the  brain  is  overwhelmed  by  the  sheer
quantity  of  facts,  stuff,  relations,  appointments,  etc.  If  information  is  simply
accumulated  (compiled),  one  should  expect  at  some  point  to  be  forgetting
practically as fast as new things are learned--it is just the brain's way of being
efficient on its own.37 This is particularly true when the focus is on compiling
facts  instead  of  reducing  facts  to  principles  and  synthesizing  more  general
theories (see Gauging mastery). The same principle holds when accumulating
things  without  learning  new  and  better  ways  to  use  them,  or  when  building
relationships without connecting them into a community. Similar arguments can
be made for computing--that is, taking on more and more work, hobbies, and
responsibilities. The maintenance costs simply grow larger and larger, and if no
complexity is created, adding another fact, thing, or relation to the "collection"
will eventually grow functionally by O(1)--that is, not at all, due to the "one
thing at a time"-constraint, whereas the maintenance costs will grow by O(N).
The main mistake when dealing with an overwhelming amount of data and
stuff is to reduce it, rather than relating to it on a more abstract level. It's always
easier to cut away than it is to create, but it's not always the best solution.

While abstraction reduces the number of concepts (see Building blocks) to
deal with, decoupling further reduces it by decreasing the number of relevant
interactions or "degrees of freedom." It's very difficult to deal with more than a
few degrees of freedom because the number of possible interactions has super
exponential  growth.38  Decoupling  decreases  the  strength  of  the  interaction
between parts. Interaction may either be described as static, instant, or dynamic,
depending on the characteristic (time and/or space) scales of the parts. Think of a
static interaction as dealing with a wall--it stays put no matter how you push it. A
dynamic interaction would be like pushing a person--the other person responds
to your pushing, but you can't just extend your arm freely. An instant interaction
would be like holding a ball in your hand--if the hand moves, the ball moves. It's
more difficult to come up with a good analogy for space, but having a large room
with  plenty  of  storage  to  spare  would  correspond  to  the  static  situation--you
could put your thing down anywhere in the room. Having "a place for everything
and  each  thing  in  its  place"  corresponds  to  the  instant  situation,  while  the
dynamic situation would be a room that's almost full and where one would have
to  rearrange  things  to  fit  things  in.  Other  dimensions  such  as  financial,
physiological,  intellectual,  emotional,  etc.  (see  Human  capital  and  necessary
personal assets) are also relevant and obey the same guidelines.
In general, interactions are easiest to deal with if they're not dynamic. For
example, the "hurry up and wait" approach in many complex organizations is the
attempt by one agent (your boss) to make the output of other agents (you) appear
static in his world as he consequently deals with a world of static problems. This
is the optimal solution for your boss as you can't be expected to solve problems
instantly,  and  dynamic  interaction  would  require  far  more  interaction  and
planning from the management side. Conversely, making this coupling dynamic,
thus increasing the degree of freedom (to fail), is frequently a source of profit
since "hurry up and wait" is an inefficient strategy when agents are only capable
or allowed to do one thing because a complex system has not been developed.
From this it immediately becomes clear why "hurry up and wait" management
strategies  tend  to  dominate  complex  organizations,  whereas  smaller
organizations are more dynamic.
This coupling problem often comes up with workload management. For a
creative  person,  workload  management  with  external  constraints  is  especially
stressful. A manager executing simple procedures may more easily divide his
day into 15-minute slots and do different things in each slot.39 A creative person
and even a craftsman can't do so, as both need time to retool. For the creative
person,  the  retooling  happens  subconsciously,  and  when  the  retooling  is

complete, inspiration suddenly strikes. This means that it's perfectly possible to
switch between things, even rapidly, according to where the inspiration strikes.
For instance, at any one time I have four to six simultaneous projects going. If I
restricted myself to just one project for the sake of simplicity, or tried to switch
projects on a pre-arranged schedule dictated by time management, there would
be a lot of downtime when my subconscious was processing a problem while I
would  be  sitting  around  doing  nothing  and  being  underutilized.  Hence,  not
allowing yourself to do anything but focus on one specific task will actually not
increase  productivity  for  creative  work.  It  will  only  increase  productivity  for
assembly  line  work  (see  Economic  degrees  of  freedom)  or  the  management
thereof.
If the dynamic dependence between parts is reduced or eliminated, failure
does not require a dynamic fix. One can either fix it instantly or simply leave it
be  and  declare  the  part  dead.  The  lack  of  cascading  interactions  increases
resilience. It should be clear that the more diverse and independent the parts of
the system are, and the more complex the system itself is, the greater its survival
rate. Conversely, a simple, specialized system with interdependent parts, like a
career professional, is likely to break as soon as circumstances change (see this
figure and this figure).  The  dynamic  response  of  a  single  part  can  further  be
reduced by introducing reserve capacity (a buffer), which ensures the ability to
maintain  a  dynamic  response  over  a  greater  range  of  circumstances.  Closely
related is the increase of peak effort, as it makes what was previously extreme,
normal. In some cases maintaining this reserve has a maintenance cost, but in
many cases it does not.
