Complexity  provides  an  advantage  over  simplicity  because  of  its  greater functionality. 
由于更好的功能性，复杂优于简单。
To wit, more is possible using a set of tools compared to a single tool. 
即，更多是使用一套工具而不是一个工具。
Complexity  allows  understanding/manipulating/using  the  same  thing  in many  ways,  which  is  useful  for  perspective,  and understanding/manipulating/using many things in the same way, which is useful for synthesis (by  using  analogous  methods). 
复杂性允许以不同的方式理解、操作、使用相同的东西，这在洞察力上是有用的；并且还能以相同的方式理解、操作、使用很多东西，这在综合力上是有用的（通过使用比拟的方法）。
Complexity,  therefore,  results  in flexibility. 
复杂性，也就是说，结果是灵活性。
Increasing  complexity  always  increases  capability  and  adaptability. 
增加复杂性通常也增加兼容性和适应性。
The human species is probably the best example of this. 
人类就是最好的例子。
Humans have the most complex  brains  of  all  species,  and  as  a  result,  we've  become  the  dominant species and been able to adapt to practically all parts of the Earth. 
人类有所以物种里最复杂的大脑，作为结果，我们成了压倒性的物种，能够适应地球上的任何部分。

However, complexity also has a cost because maintaining increasing levels of complexity requires increasingly more effort. 
然而，复杂性也增加了消耗，因为增加复杂性也要求增加更多的精力。
For instance, the human brain uses an enormous amount of energy relative to the size of the body it controls compared  to  other  mammals. 
例如，与其他哺乳动物相比，和其控制的身体大小相比，人脑所消耗了巨大的能量。
This  implies  that  there  is  an  optimal  point  of functionality  where  the  efficiency--that  is,  the  ratio  of  functionality  to maintenance  and  storage  cost--peaks. 
这意味着存在一个最佳的功能点，在该点上效率——即功能维护和存储成本的比率——达到峰值。
The  purpose  of  education,  living, interacting, and growing as a person should be to increase complexity--that is, to progress through the stages from copying to creating as described in Gauging mastery. 
作为一个人，教育、生活、互动和成长的目的，应该是增加复杂性——也就是说，在[衡量精通]()中描述的从复制到创造的阶段。
Without  this  progression,  the  brain  is  overwhelmed  by  the  sheer quantity  of  facts,  stuff,  relations,  appointments,  etc. 
如果没有这种发展，大脑就会被大量的事实、材料、关系、约定等压倒。
If  information  is  simply accumulated  (compiled),  one  should  expect  at  some  point  to  be  forgetting practically as fast as new things are learned--it is just the brain's way of being efficient on its own.37 
如果只是简单地积累（编译）信息，可预期的是在某一点上，遗忘的速度与学习新事物的速度一样快——这只是大脑自身提高效率的方式。
This is particularly true when the focus is on compiling facts  instead  of  reducing  facts  to  principles  and  synthesizing  more  general theories (see Gauging mastery). 
当重点放在汇编事实上，而不是将事实简化为原则，和综合为更一般的理论时，这一点尤其正确（参见[衡量精通]()）。
The same principle holds when accumulating things  without  learning  new  and  better  ways  to  use  them,  or  when  building relationships without connecting them into a community. 
当积累东西而不学习新的、更好的使用方法时，或者当建立关系而不将它们连接到一个社区时，同样的原则也适用。
Similar arguments can be made for computing--that is, taking on more and more work, hobbies, and responsibilities. 
类似的观点也适用于计算——也就是说，承担越来越多的工作、爱好和责任。
The maintenance costs simply grow larger and larger, and if no complexity is created, adding another fact, thing, or relation to the "collection" will eventually grow functionally by O(1)--that is, not at all, due to the "one thing at a time"-constraint, whereas the maintenance costs will grow by O(N). 
维护成本只会越来越大，如果不产生复杂性，添加另一个事实、事物或与“集合”的关系最终将在功能上增加O（1）——也就是说，因为“一次一件事”——的约束，而维护成本将增加O（N）。

The main mistake when dealing with an overwhelming amount of data and stuff is to reduce it, rather than relating to it on a more abstract level. 
处理大量数据和内容时，主要的错误是减少数据和内容，而不是在更抽象的层次上与之关联。
It's always easier to cut away than it is to create, but it's not always the best solution. 
切割总是比创造容易，但这并不总是最好的解决方案。

While abstraction reduces the number of concepts (see Building blocks) to deal with, decoupling further reduces it by decreasing the number of relevant interactions or "degrees of freedom." 
随着抽象减少了要处理的概念的数量（参见[构建模块]()），解耦更进一步减少了相关交互的数量或“自由度”。
It's very difficult to deal with more than a few degrees of freedom because the number of possible interactions has super exponential  growth.38   
解决几个自由度是非常困难的，因为交互可能性的数量会以指数增长。
Decoupling  decreases  the  strength  of  the  interaction between parts. 
解耦减少了模块间的作用力。
Interaction may either be described as static, instant, or dynamic, depending on the characteristic (time and/or space) scales of the parts. 
取决与模块的特性（时间或空间）尺度，交互可以被描述为静态、常态或动态。
Think of a static interaction as dealing with a wall--it stays put no matter how you push it. 
把静态交互想象成处理一堵墙——不管你怎么推它，它都保持不动。
A dynamic interaction would be like pushing a person--the other person responds to your pushing, but you can't just extend your arm freely. 
动态互动就像推一个人——另一个人对你的推做出反应，但你不能自由地伸出手臂。
An instant interaction would be like holding a ball in your hand--if the hand moves, the ball moves. 
即时互动就像手里拿着一个球——如果手在移动，球也在移动。
It's more difficult to come up with a good analogy for space, but having a large room with  plenty  of  storage  to  spare  would  correspond  to  the  static  situation--you could put your thing down anywhere in the room. 
很难对空间做出一个很好的类比，但是有一个大房间，有足够的存储空间，这与静态情况相对应——你可以把你的东西放在房间的任何地方。
Having "a place for everything and  each  thing  in  its  place"  corresponds  to  the  instant  situation,  while  the dynamic situation would be a room that's almost full and where one would have to  rearrange  things  to  fit  things  in. 
拥有“一个放置所有东西的地方，每个东西都在它的位置”对应于即时的情况，而动态的情况将是一个几乎满了的房间，在那里，人们将不得不重新安排事物以适应事物。
Other  dimensions  such  as  financial, physiological,  intellectual,  emotional,  etc. 
其他维度，如财务、生理、智力、情感等
(see  Human  capital  and  necessary personal assets) are also relevant and obey the same guidelines. 
（参见[人力资本和必要的个人资产]()）也是相关的，并遵循相同的准则。

In general, interactions are easiest to deal with if they're not dynamic. 
一般来说，如果交互不是动态的，那么它们最容易处理。
For example, the "hurry up and wait" approach in many complex organizations is the attempt by one agent (your boss) to make the output of other agents (you) appear static in his world as he consequently deals with a world of static problems. 
例如，在许多复杂的组织中，“抓紧时间和等待”的方法是一个代理（你的老板）试图使其他代理（你）的输出，在他的世界中看起来是静态的，因为他处理的是一个静态问题的世界。
This is the optimal solution for your boss as you can't be expected to solve problems instantly,  and  dynamic  interaction  would  require  far  more  interaction  and planning from the management side. 
这是你老板的最佳解决方案，因为你不可能马上解决问题，而动态互动需要管理层进行更多的互动和规划。
Conversely, making this coupling dynamic, thus increasing the degree of freedom (to fail), is frequently a source of profit since "hurry up and wait" is an inefficient strategy when agents are only capable or allowed to do one thing because a complex system has not been developed. 
相反，使这种耦合成为动态的，从而增加自由度（失败），通常是一种利润来源，因为当代理只能够或允许做一件事，因为复杂系统尚未开发时，“抓紧时间和等待”是一种低效的策略。
From this it immediately becomes clear why "hurry up and wait" management strategies  tend  to  dominate  complex  organizations,  whereas  smaller organizations are more dynamic. 
从这一点可以立即清楚地看出，为什么“抓紧时间和等待”管理策略往往主导复杂的组织，而较小的组织则更具活力。

This coupling problem often comes up with workload management. 
这种耦合问题经常出现在工作负载管理中。
For a creative  person,  workload  management  with  external  constraints  is  especially stressful. 
对于一个有创造力的人来说，有外部约束的工作量管理尤其令人紧张。
A manager executing simple procedures may more easily divide his day into 15-minute slots and do different things in each slot.39 A creative person and even a craftsman can't do so, as both need time to retool. 
执行简单程序的经理，可以更容易地将一天分成15分钟的时间段，并在每个时间段内做不同的事情。一个有创造力的人甚至一个工匠都不能这样做，因为他们都需要时间来重新装备。
For the creative person,  the  retooling  happens  subconsciously,  and  when  the  retooling  is complete, inspiration suddenly strikes. 
对于有创造力的人来说，重新装备是下意识的，当重新装备完成时，灵感突然袭来。
This means that it's perfectly possible to switch between things, even rapidly, according to where the inspiration strikes. 
这意味着，完全可以根据灵感的来源在事物之间切换，甚至可以快速切换。
For instance, at any one time I have four to six simultaneous projects going. 
例如，在任何时候，我都有四到六个同时进行的项目。
If I restricted myself to just one project for the sake of simplicity, or tried to switch projects on a pre-arranged schedule dictated by time management, there would be a lot of downtime when my subconscious was processing a problem while I would  be  sitting  around  doing  nothing  and  being  underutilized. 
如果为了简单起见，我把自己限制在一个项目上，或者试图按照时间管理规定的、预先安排的时间表切换项目，那么当我的潜意识在处理一个问题时，就会有很多停机时间，而我则未充分发挥、无所事事地坐着。
Hence,  not allowing yourself to do anything but focus on one specific task will actually not increase  productivity  for  creative  work. 
因此，不允许自己做其他事情，只专注于一项特定的任务，实际上不会提高创造性工作的生产率。
It  will  only  increase  productivity  for assembly  line  work  (see  Economic  degrees  of  freedom)  or  the  management thereof. 
它只会提高装配线工作（参见[经济上的自由度]()）或其管理的生产率。

If the dynamic dependence between parts is reduced or eliminated, failure does not require a dynamic fix. 
如果减少或消除了零件之间的动态相关性，则故障不需要动态修复。
One can either fix it instantly or simply leave it be  and  declare  the  part  dead. 
人们可以立即修复它，也可以干脆不动它，直接宣布部件已死亡。
The  lack  of  cascading  interactions  increases resilience. 
缺乏级联交互提高了恢复力。
It should be clear that the more diverse and independent the parts of the system are, and the more complex the system itself is, the greater its survival rate. 
应该清楚的是，系统的各个部分越是多样化和独立，系统本身越是复杂，其生存率就越高。
Conversely, a simple, specialized system with interdependent parts, like a career professional, is likely to break as soon as circumstances change (see this figure and this figure). 
相反，一个简单的、专业化的、相互依存的系统，如职业专业人员，一旦环境发生变化，很可能就会崩溃（参见此[图]()和此[图]()）。
The  dynamic  response  of  a  single  part  can  further  be reduced by introducing reserve capacity (a buffer), which ensures the ability to maintain  a  dynamic  response  over  a  greater  range  of  circumstances. 
通过引入备用容量（缓冲区），可以进一步降低单个部件的动态响应，从而确保在更大范围的情况下保持动态响应的能力。
Closely related is the increase of peak effort, as it makes what was previously extreme, normal. 
与此密切相关的是峰值努力的增加，因为它使以前极端的情况变得正常。
In some cases maintaining this reserve has a maintenance cost, but in many cases it does not. 
在某些情况下，维护该储备需要维护成本，但在许多情况下并非如此。
