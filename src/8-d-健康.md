Think  of  health  as  wealth--the  wealth  that  matters  most--and  being  wealth, its usefulness lies in its ability to serve as an asset in our lives.

The healthier the life, the better the life.

What is health? Consider the way a child feels about his body.

He can't stay still and wants to jump around--almost can't help himself.

How many adults do that? Indeed, not many.

Many  adults  act  as  if  moving  is  not  particularly  enjoyable.

Given  the choice,  they'd  rather  not  move  around.

To  them,  moving  is  uncomfortable, exhausting, and even painful.

Consider the curiosity of a child, always asking questions about this and that to learn about the world.

Children express themselves creatively when given the chance.

Here too, only a few adults are creative, imaginative, lifelong learners.

Those  who  are  can't  help  themselves:  They  are  mentally  healthy  and  never bored.

Learning  comes  easy  to  them.

Conversely,  many  have  little  imagination left and would prefer not to think, especially if they have to change their mind or break a few conventions to be able to think about something.

Consider  that  most  parents  love  their  children  unconditionally  and  thus children enjoy unlimited social support.

As the child grows up, the "innocence" soon  wears  off,  though.

Indeed,  the  current  psychiatric  and  sociological paradigm  defines  social  health  as  being  adjusted  to  the  prevailing  norms  and culture.

After all, we're  all cogs in the  machine, and if a cog doesn't work,  the prevailing dogma is that it must be sick and broken.

Why then is there so much depression and so many prescription drugs designed to make people stop caring so  they  can  be  neutrally  "happy?"77  Instead,  it  makes  sense  to  define  social wealth as parallel to mental and physical health.

As such, it should be measured by the strength of one's relationships to the people one chooses to associate with- -one's tribe, so to speak.

Health is thus a condition of well-being and an ability to appreciate life.

It's not necessarily optimizing or conforming to a set of measurable quantities like life expectancy or blood pressure, nor is it removing all symptoms using drugs.

Health  is  the  presence  of  something  positive,  rather  than  the  absence  of something negative.
