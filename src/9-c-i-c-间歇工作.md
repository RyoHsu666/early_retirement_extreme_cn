It's important to note that the time units in the  table are  irrelevant.
需要注意的是，[表]()中的时间单位是不相关的。
Given  a 50% savings rate, there's no rule that one has to work 1 year and take the next year  off,  although  this  solution  is  growing  in  popularity.
考虑到50%的储蓄率，没有规定一个人必须工作一年，第二年休假，尽管这种解决方案越来越受欢迎。
It's  equally  valid  to work 3 years and take the next 3 years off.
这和工作三年休息三年是等效的。
A flexible work schedule would mean that instead of counting in years, you could be counting in months or even days or  hours  (a  one  hour  work  day,  anyone?).
灵活的工作计划意味着，你可以用月、甚至天或小时（一小时的工作日，任何人？）来计算，而不是用年来计算。
In  other  words,  with  a  20%  savings rate, you could take 1 month off each time you work 4 months, or 1 day off each time you work 4 days.
换句话说，有了20%的储蓄率，你可以每工作4个月休息一个月，或者每工作4天休息一天。
Alternatively, with a 75% savings rate, you could work 3 months and take the rest of the year off.
或者，有了75%的储蓄率，你可以工作3个月，然后休息一年。
This works for anyone with a great deal of  control  over  the  timing  of  his  income--for  example,  entrepreneurs,  seasonal workers (farmers, tax accountants), freelancers, skilled travelers and contractors, handymen; in general, anyone who can easily find work without committing to an  extended  employment.
这适用于对收入时间有很大控制权的任何人——例如，企业家、季节性工人（农民、税务会计）、自由职业者、熟练旅行者和承包商、工匠；一般来说，任何人都可以轻松找到工作，而无需延长雇佣期。
Conversely,  it  doesn't  work  well  for  salaried  career professionals.
相反，这对领薪水的职业专业人士来说并不奏效。
