The  thing  that  most  Americans  live  for  and  which  permeates  the  entire culture,  the  car, is an incredibly expensive piece  of machinery, with  barriers  to nonownership that must be dealt with emotionally and physically. 

It's likely that universal  car  ownership  was  one  of  the  larger  mistakes  of  American  society. 

When few people have cars, cars means freedom. 

When everybody has cars, cars mean  sitting  in  endless  lines,  emitting  pollution,  and  not  having  a  car  means freedom. 

Many people are in such poor shape that they can't get anywhere under their  own  power. 

This  is  a  physical  barrier  to  nonownership. 

However,  anyone can  walk  efficiently  with  practice. 

I  still  remember  getting  passed  by  several 60+-year-olds  during  a  two  day  double-marathon  walk--I  had  no  training;  they had plenty--happily marching  along,  commenting  on the  pretty  flowers  while  I was  dragging  my  18-year-old  sedentary  feet  along,  only  concentrating  on  the next painful step. 

Many believe that not having a car is unsafe, despite the fact that more people die in automobile accidents than are killed by guns every year. 

This is a mental barrier to car nonownership. 


Next  to  housing  cost,  transportation  costs  are  American's  second  biggest source of expenses. 

Car ownership has some or all of the following costs: 


1. Depreciation,  leasing,  or  debt  servicing  costs. 

Leasing  or  debt  servicing costs are relevant if you don't own your car outright. 

If you own your car outright  and  you  intend  to  replace  it,  depreciation  costs  become  relevant. 

For instance, $12,000 for a car that lasts 10 years costs $100 a month. 

That requires  $40,100  in  extra  savings  (see  this  equation  in  Investing  and reasonable return rates). 

2. Gasoline  and  insurance. 

These  are  unavoidable  if  you  want  to  drive  your car anywhere, except perhaps downhill on backroads. 

3. Opportunity and health costs from sitting behind the wheel when you could be exercising. 

The average American spends 20% of his income on transportation. 

That is 0.20×12=2.4 months a year of work. 

That is a lot of time that could be used for something better. 

Assuming he also spends an hour daily in his car commuting, then  that  is  250  hours  a  year,  assuming  250  working  days. 

That  is  1/8  of  the working day on top of the working day or 1/8 of the working month on top of the  working  month. 

Hence,  that  is  12/8  =  1.5  working  months  in  addition, meaning  we  end  up  working  four  months  a  year  driving  and  earning transportation funds. 


Hence if it would otherwise take you six years of work to retire, if you own a car you will only be able to save (12-4)/12 as much, so your time until retirement would  extend  to  12/(12-4)×6=9  years,  or  three  additional  years  simply  due  to driving. 

If you calculate 12 years until retirement, then you're really looking at 18, or six more years. 


Giving up the car makes sense. 

First you'll save money on exercise. 

Driving your  car  over  to  a  gym  to  run  on  a  treadmill,  then  driving  back  again  is inefficient at best. 

If walked or biked to and from work, not only would you save the money otherwise spent on a car, you'd also save the money normally spent on a gym membership. 

Many people past college age completely ignore physical fitness. 

It  seems  like  a  degree  and  a  career  also  serve  as  a  subscription  to physical decline. 

If you're going to retire early, it will be sad to sit on the couch all day, being shut out of physical activities due to a belief that weakness comes from age. 


I'd  consider  it  normal  to--without  preparation  or  prior  training  other  than  a daily  commute--be  able  to  run  five  miles,  walk  25  miles,  or  bike  50  miles. 

Perhaps  these  numbers  sound  insane. 

This  suggests  a  large  chasm  between  the frame of mind of someone who gets around using gasoline, and a walker, runner, or rider who gets around under his own power. 


Walkers easily travel three miles by foot. 

Drivers get in their cars to get from one side of the parking lot to the other. 

Neither quite understand why the other is so crazy, when it's so easy to do things their way. 


Not having access to an automobile means rediscovering the art of planning. 

Do  your  shopping  in  fewer  trips,  or  alternatively  plan  to  live  closer  to  the market. 

I  used  to  shop  every  other  day  on  the  way  home  from  work,  which meant  I  could  buy  food  with  fewer  preservatives  and  chemical  additives. 

Interestingly enough, it seems that as long as you know someone who is going the same way, they are usually happy to offer you a ride. 

Don't forget to extend favors in the other direction, like offering to pay for gas. 


"But what about the children? Surely they need to be ferried around." They need to live close enough to their school that they can ride a bike or walk or take the bus (consider this in How to find shelter). 

Good habits are best started early. 

Consider a trailer bike. 

Consider walking them to school, or at least to the bus. 

When I was a kid I lived two miles from my school, and my mom walked me back  and  forth  for  the  first  year. 

When  you're  free  from  your  job,  you'll  have time  for  this--it's  a  meaningful  thing  to  do. 

It's,  in  my  opinion,  better  than working for more years so you can drive your kids back and forth in a van.
