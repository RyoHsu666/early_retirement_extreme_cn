Borrowing is  another  method.

The  cardinal  rule  of  borrowing  is  always  to return  the  borrowed  item  in  the  same  or  better  condition.

There  should  be  no exceptions to this rule.

Returning something slightly damaged or dirty is almost guaranteed  to  cut  you  out  of  the  loop  the  next  time  you  want  to  borrow something.

Lending your things out can also be a way of having access to them without having to store them.

Now, you may think that giving your books to the library  will  allow  you  to  borrow  them  back  and  not  have  to  store  them constantly;  however,  libraries  will  most  likely  sell  your  books  instead  to  cover their operating costs.
