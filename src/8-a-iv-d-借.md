借是另一种方法。
The  cardinal  rule  of  borrowing  is  always  to return  the  borrowed  item  in  the  same  or  better  condition.
借的基本原则总是以相同或更好的状态归还借来的物品。
There  should  be  no exceptions to this rule.
这条规则不应有例外。
Returning something slightly damaged or dirty is almost guaranteed  to  cut  you  out  of  the  loop  the  next  time  you  want  to  borrow something.

借出你的东西也可以是一种无需存储就可以访问它们的方式。
Now, you may think that giving your books to the library  will  allow  you  to  borrow  them  back  and  not  have  to  store  them constantly;  however,  libraries  will  most  likely  sell  your  books  instead  to  cover their operating costs.
现在，你可能认为将你的书交给图书馆，可以让你将它们借回来，而不必存放它们； 但是，图书馆很可能会出售你的书以支付其运营成本。
