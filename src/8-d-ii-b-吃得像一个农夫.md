Most  animals  don't  have  breakfast,  lunch,  and  dinner. 

Why  do  we?  The standard  three  meals  a  day  model  is  very  useful  for  anyone  engaging  in  heavy manual  labor  like  farmwork  or  early  industrial  work. 

Obviously,  work  can't  be stopped  all  the  time  for  a  snack  break,  but  it's  impossible  to  eat  enough  in  the morning  to  last  for  an  entire  day  of  hard  work. 

Three  meals  are  thus  a  good compromise. 

Breakfast would fuel four hours of work, lunch would fuel another four  hours  of  work  and  dinner  would  fuel  eight  hours  of  nonwork  and  eight hours of sleep, nominally. 

For people engaged in light manual labor, this diet is a problem, particularly if highly glycemic foods are eaten at lunch resulting in an insulin spike that drops blood sugar levels precipitously. 

Not only can this make a  person  hungry,91  but  the  high  level  of  insulin  also  makes  one  very  tired. 

A quick  way  to  fix  this  is  to  quickly  engage  in  intensive  workout--for  example, spend  20  minutes  doing  all-out  HIIT  (see  High  intensity  interval  training). 

Another  option  is  to  store  the  excess  energy  around  the  midsection  and  grab  a cup of coffee or one of the heavily marketed energy drinks.
