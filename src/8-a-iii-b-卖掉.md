If  the  value  is  higher,  things  can  be  sold.

Everything  I  own  is  for  sale, always.

Ask  me  and  I  will  give  you  a  quote.

Not  only  does  this  constantly remind me of the value of my possessions, but it prevents me from developing an  attachment  to  the  thing  in  question.

A  more  enlightened  state  would  be  to always  be  willing  to  give  away  everything  I  own.

Unfortunately,  I'm  not sufficiently skillful, nor do I as yet own so little to easily be able to reacquire and recreate everything I own, but that would be something to strive for.

To sell things, I use online services exclusively.

Online services like Craig's List  are  useful  for  common  and  generic  items  like  furniture,  garden  tools, bicycles,  toys, etc.

Listing  is  free  and  the  transaction  is  cash-based  and  hassle- free.

For odd things that can be mailed, online auctions and marketplaces  offer a wider  audience.

Many  will  offer  a  number  of  free  listings  each  month,  so  take advantage of that.

I usually pick a price point near the bottom to ensure a quick sale.

Check back frequently to see if anyone is underpricing you.
