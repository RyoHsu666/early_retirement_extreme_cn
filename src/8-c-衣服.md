In a business setting, men wear suits suitable for unheated or poorly heated rooms  in  a  cold  temperate  climate,  namely  England,  where  the  business  suit
originated. 

 Because  of  tradition,  businessmen  and  office  workers  wear  woolen two-or  three-piece  suits  regardless  of  the  climate  they  live  in,  and  office buildings  are  air-conditioned  to  an  English  climate  so  that  workers  may comfortably over-dress even if the weather outside calls for t-shirts. 
 
 Dress more compatibly  with  the  weather  and  save  money  on  trying  to  change  the temperature  (see  Heating  and  cooling);  this  is  possible  if  you're  not  subject  to dress code restrictions,  either  by  working  from  home  (see  Telecommuting  and work)  or  working  in  an  occupation  where  your  attire  must  not  conform  to customer  expectations  or  affect  shareholder  profits. 

 Like  with  heating  and cooling  (see  Heating  and  cooling),  clothing  should  follow  the  seasons. 

 I  wear wool suits during the winter; they're very comfortable and last a long time.
