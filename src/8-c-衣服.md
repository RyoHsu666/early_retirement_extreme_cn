In a business setting, men wear suits suitable for unheated or poorly heated rooms  in  a  cold  temperate  climate,  namely  England,  where  the  business  suit originated.
在商务环境中，男士们穿的西装适合寒冷温带气候中没有暖气或暖气不足的房间，也就是商务套装的发源地英格兰。
Because  of  tradition,  businessmen  and  office  workers  wear  woolen two-or  three-piece  suits  regardless  of  the  climate  they  live  in,  and  office buildings  are  air-conditioned  to  an  English  climate  so  that  workers  may comfortably over-dress even if the weather outside calls for t-shirts.
由于传统，商人和上班族无论居住的气候如何，都会穿羊毛两件套或三件套西装，办公楼的空调适应英国气候，即使外面的天气需要穿T恤，工作人员也可以舒适地穿着西装。
Dress more compatibly  with  the  weather  and  save  money  on  trying  to  change  the temperature  (see  Heating  and  cooling);  this  is  possible  if  you're  not  subject  to dress code restrictions,  either  by  working  from  home  (see  Telecommuting  and work)  or  working  in  an  occupation  where  your  attire  must  not  conform  to customer  expectations  or  affect  shareholder  profits.
穿着更适合天气，并在尝试改变温度时节省费用（参见[加热和冷却]()）；如果你不受着装规定的限制，无论是在家工作（参见[通信和工作]()），还是着装不影响客户期望也不会影响股东利润的职业中工作，这都是可能的。
Like  with  heating  and cooling  (see  Heating  and  cooling),  clothing  should  follow  the  seasons.
就像加热和冷却中提到过的（参见[加热和冷却]()），衣服应该随季节而变化。
I  wear wool suits during the winter; they're very comfortable and last a long time.
冬天我穿羊毛套装；它们很舒服，而且可以穿很长时间。
