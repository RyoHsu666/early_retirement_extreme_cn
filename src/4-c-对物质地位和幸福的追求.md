Our  culture  was  founded  on  the  idea  that  maximizing  production  equals maximizing happiness. 
我们的文化建立在，生产最大化等于幸福最大化的理念之上。
In the past, pursuing this goal was admirable since any increase in production resulted in an increase in well-being: better food, better medicine, better clothing, better housing, better work, and better living. 
在过去，追求这个目标是令人钦佩的，因为，任何生产的增加，都会导致福祉的增加：更好的食物、更好的药物、更好的衣服、更好的住房、更好的工作和更好的生活。
At some point the focus changed from better to more: more food, more medicine, more clothing, more bedrooms, more bathrooms, and more work. 
在某个点，重点从更好变成了更多：更多的食物、更多的药物、更多的衣服、更多的卧室、更多的浴室和更多的工作。
But can we honestly say this still results in better living and greater well-being?
但我们能否坦诚地说，这仍然会带来更好更幸福的生活？

The  changing  focus--from  better  to  more--signaled  the  transition  from  a producer economy to a consumer economy. 
不断变化的焦点——从更好到更多——标志着从生产经济向消费经济的转变。
Whereas the biggest problem of the producer economy was how to produce and distribute enough goods to survive--a problem that still hasn't been solved on a global scale--the biggest problem of a consumer economy is how to clear the market of overproduced goods.
生产者经济的最大问题是，如何生产和分配足够的商品来生存——这个问题在全球范围内仍未解决——而消费经济的最大问题是，如何清理市场上的过度生产的商品。

There are two ways to solve this problem: either produce less or increase consumption. 
解决这个问题有两种方法：要么减少生产，要么增加消费。
Various strategies for working less, such as more vacation time and  longer  educations,  decrease  productivity.13  Yet,  there  are  many  more strategies  for  consuming  more--government  strategies  as  well  as  corporate strategies.
减少工作的各种策略，例如更多的休假时间和更长的教育时间，会降低生产力。然而，还有更多的消费策略——政府策略和企业策略。

Government  strategies,  driven  by  the  political  currency  of  popular  votes, comprise  inflation-inducing  monetary  policies,  which  cause  people  to  spend their money now rather than save it for later, and fiscal policies, which promote government projects ranging from military expenditures and wars to job-creating projects, such as building bridges to nowhere, to direct stimulus packages for the consumers--formerly known as citizens.
受民众选票的政治货币驱动的政府战略，包括引发通货膨胀的货币政策，导致人们现在花钱而不是留着以后用；财政政策，从增加军费开支和开启战争，到创造就业的政府项目，例如架起通往任何地方的桥梁，为消费者（以前称为公民）提供刺激计划。

Many  profit-driven  corporate  strategies  are  based  on  fashion,  planned obsolescence,  unneeded  upgrades,  and  masterful  emotional  manipulation  -- marketing--causing people to continuously replace goods which are still in good working order.
许多以利润驱动的企业战略都是基于时尚、计划性淘汰、不必要的升级和高超的情绪操纵——营销——诱使人们不断更换仍处于良好工作状态的商品。

Although  these  strategies  seem  to  fail  tactically  in  an  almost  predictable fashion, with booms and busts, recessions and depressions, or simply chronic mismanagement,  when  centrally  regulated  and  directed,  the  strategies  have proven immensely powerful on secular time scales. 
尽管这些战略在几乎可以预测的方式在战术上失败，比如繁荣和萧条、衰退和萧条，或者简单地说是长期管理不善，但在中央监管和指导下，这些战略在长期时间尺度上被证明是非常强大的。
One result is that humanity has used up half of the oil--an ancient resource generated millions of years ago--within a span of a century, while measurably affecting the world's biosphere and climate. 
一个结果是，人类在一个世纪的时间内消耗了一半的石油——一种数百万年前产生的古老资源，同时对世界生物圈和气候产生了重大影响。
 Since  such  resources  are  finite,  these  strategies  can't  be  sustained.
由于这些资源是有限的，这些战略无法持续。 
Economic growth--how quickly resources are converted into consumer goods--is
considered  desirable  by  the  economic  profession,  while  biologists,
psychologists, and sociologists are tallying up the losses. 
经济增长——资源转化为消费品的速度——被经济学界认为是可取的，而生物学家、心理学家和社会学家正在统计损失。
However, if individual companies  measured  growth  in  the  same  way--by  generating  income  while ignoring that the income is generated by rapidly burning through their capital assets--shareholders  would  be  protesting. 
然而，如果个别公司以同样的方式衡量增长——通过创造收入，而忽视收入是通过快速烧掉其资本资产而产生的——股东们就会抗议。
 In  a  world  where  automation  has eliminated  pride  in  workmanship  from  the  products  and  nobody  has  time  for much  else  than  work,  status  is  based  on  acquisition  and  accumulation. 
在一个自动化已经从产品中消除了对工艺的自豪感，没有人有时间做工作以外的事情的世界里，地位是建立在获得和积累的基础上的。
 The purchase and consumption of products has become a surrogate for creating and doing. 
产品的购买和消费已经成为创造和行动的替代品。
Self-worth and status, then, are not about intrinsic values such as who you are, what you can do, or what you know; they're about extrinsic values like what you can buy, the car you drive, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms in your home,  and  the  price  tags  on  your  clothes. 
因此，自我价值和地位与内在价值无关，比如你是谁，你能做什么，或者你知道什么；它们是关于外在价值的，比如你能买什么，你开什么车，你家里卧室和浴室的数量，以及你衣服上的价格标签。
 Witness  the  popular  shows  about highly stylized homes with a TV in every room--TV being a way of consuming your  time  rather  than  your  money--expensive  furniture,  and  art  prints  on  the walls. 
看看那些流行的节目吧，这些节目讲述的是高度风格化的房子，每个房间都有一台电视的——电视是一种耗费时间而不是金钱的方式——昂贵的家具，墙上还有艺术印刷品。
Now go and look again, but pay attention to the number of books on the bookshelves, the tools for the hobby projects, the work in progress spread out on the desk. 
现在再去看看，但要注意书架上的书的数量，爱好项目的工具，桌子上展开的正在进行的工作。
There are none. 
没有。
What empty lives these people must live.
这些人必须过着多么空虚的生活。

Having substituted consumption for creativity and technical skills, shopping becomes a form of self-actualization--there's no small number of teenage girls who  associate  personal  growth  with  changing  their  wardrobe--"retail therapy" becomes an active way of feeling good. 
购物取代了消费，取代了创造力和技术技能，成为自我实现的一种形式——有不少十几岁的女孩，将个人成长与改变和衣橱联系在一起——“零售疗法”成为一种感觉良好的积极方式。
Shopping, then, becomes an end in itself rather than a means to an end. 
于是，购物本身就成了目的，而不是达到目的的手段。
Rather than designing for yourself, purchasing professional designs or brand name-associated "lifestyles" becomes the preferred way of expressing who you are, and consumers start connecting with each other based on the things and brands they buy. 
与其为自己设计，不如购买专业设计，与品牌名称相关的“生活方式”，成为表达你是谁的首选方式，消费者开始根据他们购买的物品和品牌相互联系。
Such consumption manifests itself in different ways.
这种消费以不同的方式表现出来。

For  some,  status-driven  experiences  are  sought  out. 
对一些人来说，地位驱动的经验被寻找出来。
 Rather  than  refining experiences, like learning to identify bird songs during a walk in the park, new and more exorbitant experiences are sought out, and travel agencies are happy to offer  them  up. 
与在公园散步时，学习识别鸟叫声等精炼体验不同，人们会寻找新的、更昂贵的体验，旅行社也乐于提供这些体验。
 Many  such  trips  resemble  harried  business  trips  rather  than relaxing vacations. 
许多这样的旅行类似于繁忙的商务旅行，而不是放松的假期。
"Work hard, play hard."
“努力工作，努力玩耍。”

Others  attempt  to  create  meaning  through  collecting;  that  is,  a  systematic form of hoarding. 
其他人试图通过收集来创造意义；也就是说，一种系统的囤积形式。
Entire industries have been created that appeal to the hoarding instinct, creating things to collect with no use value whatsoever. 
整个行业都被创造出来，吸引着囤积的本能，创造出毫无使用价值的收藏物品。
These things don't even have any intrinsic or collectible value, but consumers collect them anyway and work hard to do so.
这些东西甚至没有任何内在的或可收集的价值，但消费者无论如何都会收集它们，并且做得很努力。

For many, status is associated with expensive items thought to be fitting for someone with a higher salary. 
对许多人来说，地位与被认为适合高薪人士的昂贵物品有关。
Certain jobs are associated with certain levels of spending. 
某些工作与特定的支出水平相关。
This means that the price itself is often considered a complementary good--the item is considered desirable simply because it's expensive. 
这意味着价格本身通常被认为是一种补足品——该商品之所以被认为是可取的，仅仅是因为它很贵。
This locks one into a spiral of "upgrading": An expensive shirt leads to the purchase of an expensive  suit;  the  car  must  match  the  expensive  home. 
这将一个人锁定在“升级”的螺旋中：昂贵的衬衫导致购买昂贵的西装；这辆车必须和这套昂贵的房子相配。
 An  increase  in  pay allows  one  to  buy  goods  which  previously  seemed  like  a  luxury. 
工资的增加，使人们能够购买以前似乎是奢侈品的商品。
 Another increase leads to another upgrade. 
另一个增加导致另一个升级。
Soon these become a normal part of life and people  start  identifying  with  them. 
很快这些就成为了生活中正常的一部分，人们开始认同它们。
 When  you  identify  with  an  object,  you're defined by the object, then controlled by it, and ultimately owned by it. 
当你认同一个对象时，你由该对象定义，然后由它控制，最后由它拥有。
If you relate to your possessions, you're owned by your stuff, and it will make many of your decisions for you. 
如果你关联到你的财产，你就被你的东西拥有，它会为你做出许多决定。
This trap is not only mental, but also physical.
这个陷阱不仅是精神上的，而且是身体上的。

When moving into a new place, there's a tendency to rapidly fill all rooms with furniture (and TVs)--perhaps there's a taboo against empty rooms? 
当搬进一个新的地方时，有一种趋势是，所有的房间都会很快被家具（和电视）填满——也许空房间是个禁忌？
Those extra rooms, which are rarely used--the so-called media rooms, the basement bar, the craftsroom--are then used for storage space and slowly fill with stuff that people "need" yet never use. 
那些很少使用的额外房间——所谓的媒体室、地下酒吧、工艺室——然后被用作存储空间，慢慢填满人们“需要”但从未使用过的东西。
In fact, in many houses, those rooms, like attached garages, serve no purpose other than storing unused stuff and furniture. 
事实上，在许多房屋中，这些房间就像附属的车库一样，除了存放未使用的东西和家具外，没有其他用途。
This of course makes it challenging to move into somewhere smaller. 
当然，这使得搬到更小的地方很有挑战性。
In particular, the very idea of moving is rejected because it requires too much effort. 
特别是，搬家的想法被取消，因为这需要太多的努力。
So not only are people attached to their stuff, they're also attached to their homes.
因此，人们不仅对自己的东西感兴趣，还对自己的家感兴趣。

Continuously accruing stuff soon makes any home too small, regardless of its  size. 
不断积累的东西很快就会使任何一个家变得太小，不管它有多大。
 Therefore  much  effort  has  gone  into  optimizing  total  square  footage including repurposing the garage and parking the car on the street. 
因此，在优化总占地面积方面付出了很大的努力，包括重新调整车库的用途，和在街上停车。
People don't seem to realize that the quest to bring more possessions in through the front door is a chronic disease, and that the shortage of space is a symptom rather than an underlying  problem. 
人们似乎没有意识到，通过前门带来更多财产的追求，是一种慢性病，而空间不足是一种症状，而不是根本问题。
 Consequently,  modern  homes  are  mostly  big,  poorly constructed, oorly located, and financially leveraged. 
因此，现代住宅大多是大型的、结构简陋的、地理位置优越的、财务杠杆作用的。
Like the big gas guzzlers used to drive back and forth to them, they're very energy-intensive, and thus, in light of nascent resource constraints, are also outdated and old-fashioned.
就像过去来来回回的大型耗油汽车一样，它们是能源密集型的，因此，考虑到刚刚出现的资源限制，它们已经过气了。

Ironically, buying things is often used as a "deserved" reward for hard work: "Why don't you go and buy yourself something nice?" The idea is that work is drudgery, so in order to ease the pain, the money earned working is spent on some gadget, thus requiring more work. 
具有讽刺意味的是，买东西通常被用作努力工作“应得的”回报：“你为什么不去给自己买点好东西呢？”他们的想法是，工作是一件苦差事，所以为了减轻痛苦，工作挣来的钱会花在一些小玩意儿上，但这需要更多的工作。
This spiral makes little sense, so either work  isn't  so  bad,  or perhaps  there  is  another  reason  for  this  behavior. 
这种螺旋关系没有什么意义，所以要么工作没那么糟糕，要么这种行为可能还有另一个原因。
 One reason may be that many people are salaried full-time employees. 
其中一个原因可能是许多人是领薪水的全职雇员。
They can't choose to work any less, so they might as well spend the superfluous money they earn.
他们不能选择少工作，所以他们把赚来的多余的钱花掉。

As a result, no matter how much someone earns, expenses tend to match income. 
因此，无论一个人挣多少钱，支出往往与收入相匹配。
This is called lifestyle inflation. 
这就是所谓的生活方式通货膨胀。
Without the wisdom to determine when enough is enough, consumption is taken to its extreme and people still work as much as ever, if not more, despite doubling their productivity over the past half century.
如果没有智慧来决定什么时候足够，消费就会达到极限，人们的工作仍然和以前一样多，如果不是更多的话，尽管在过去的半个世纪里，生产率翻了一番。

On the homefront the growing use of time-saving technology doesn't result in time saved either. 
在家庭方面，越来越多地使用省时技术也不会节省时间。
Rather, it results in more being done. 
相反，它会带来更多的工作。
For instance, thanks to the washing machine, clothes are now washed more than ever before, and as a result households spend as much time doing laundry as they did before washers moved into people's homes.14 
例如，由于有了洗衣机，现在洗衣服的次数比以往任何时候都多，因此家庭花在洗衣服上的时间与洗衣机搬进人们家之前一样多。
It seems to be a tragicomic fact that every time-saving  invention  is  immediately  canceled  out  by  an  increase  in  activity  or  a change of behavior. 
每一项节省时间的发明，都会因为活动的增加，或行为的改变而立即被取消，这似乎是一个悲剧性的事实。
When the automobile was made affordable to the masses, people  moved  further  away  from  work  and  further  away  from  stores. 
当汽车被大众买得起时，人们住得离工作更远，离商店更远。
 While transportation speed increased, transportation distance increased proportionally, keeping transportation time constant. 
当运输速度增加时，运输距离成比例增加，运输时间不变。
It did, however, result in the creation of the auto industry, and thus created jobs.
虽然，这确实创造了汽车工业，从而创造了就业机会。

On the surface, job creation may look positive, but all it has accomplished is to replace a previously simple and noneconomic activity, such as walking, with an entire industry of building cars, highways, and oil rigs to accomplish the same task of getting between places. 
从表面上看，创造就业机会可能是积极的，但它完成的只是用制造汽车、高速公路和石油钻塔的整个行业，来取代以前简单且不经济的活动，如步行，以完成同样的往返任务。
Cars can go many places, but most trips can just as easily be done in an hour of walking by choosing one's home location wisely (see How to find shelter). 
汽车可以去很多地方，但通过明智地选择自己的居住地（参见[如何找到庇护所]()），大多数旅行都可以在一小时的步行时间内完成的。
If you wish to go further, there are other means as well.
如果你想走得更远，还有其他方法。

Many other activities which people used to do themselves have also been turned into products. 
人们过去自己做的许多其他活动，也变成了产品。
Consequently, people spend time working to buy products rather than learning and doing the activity themselves. 
因此，人们把时间花在购买产品上，而不是自己学习和做这些活动。
The result is a downward spiral of fewer skills -> greater need for technology -> more work -> less time to practice the remaining skills -> further loss of competence. 
结果是技能减少->对技术的需求增加->工作增加->练习剩余技能的时间减少->能力进一步丧失。
The more things consumers think they need, the more control they relinquish over their lives and the more their lives are shaped by the products they own. 
消费者认为他们需要的东西越多，他们对自己的生活放弃的控制就越多，他们的生活也就越受，他们所拥有的产品的影响。
Thanks to the focus on technology, many skills have been forgotten--eggs can't be boiled without egg boilers, bread can't be toasted without a toaster, and the counter can't be cleaned without dye-colored chemical products. 
由于对技术的关注，很多技能都被遗忘了——没有煮蛋器就不能煮鸡蛋，没有烤面包机就不能烤面包，没有染色的化学制品就不能清洗柜台。
Walking five miles is now considered an ordeal to be avoided. 
步行八公里现在被认为是一种需要避免的痛苦。
Nobody with a conventional frame of mind would spend one  hour  walking  every  day  when  they  could  drive. 
如果能开车的话，没有一个有传统思维的人会每天花一个小时步行。
 Yet  people  don't  stop  to reconsider spending 10 weeks each year working full-time to pay for that car just to avoid the inconvenience of a daily hour of "laborious" walking and fresh air.
然而，人们不会停下来重新考虑，每年花10周全职工作的时间买来车的，只是为了避免每天一小时的“费力”步行，和新鲜空气带来的不便。

This idea of economic growth seems to be a very intricate version of digging holes and filling them up again. 
这种经济增长的观点似乎是，一个非常复杂的版本的，挖坑再填。
It creates economic growth in the traditional sense,  but  so  does  breaking  a  window  and  replacing  it. 
它创造了传统意义上的经济增长，但打破一扇窗户并修好它也是如此。
 What  is  ignored  are wasted effort and natural resources, which should be subtracted from the growth calculation  to  reveal  a  more  accurate  number  of  how  well  people,  not  the "economy," are doing.
被忽视的是浪费的努力和自然资源，这些应该从增长计算中扣除，以更准确地反映人们的状况，而不是“经济”的表现。
