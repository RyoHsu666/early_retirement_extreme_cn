It  is  possible  to  change  "species."   Regardless  of  the  initial  state  or  large bumps  along  the  way,  people  gravitate  toward  the  outcomes  their  behavior induces. 
改变“物种”是可能的。不管初始状态如何，也不管途径有多大的坎坷，人们都会被他们的行为所导致的结果所吸引。
As  "species"  have  different  types  of  behavior,  one  must  change behavior to change species. 
由于“物种”有不同类型的行为，人们必须改变行为来改变物种。
There's no faking it, nor is there any "buying" it. 
这里没法伪造它，也没法“购买”它。
People do not change due to a single clever idea; they are what they are based on the totality of their behavior. 
人们不会因为一个聪明的想法而改变；他们是基于他们行为的整体。

In other words, luck is only important in the short term. 
换句话说，运气只在短期内重要。
In the long term, luck has little to do with success. 
从长远来看，运气与成功关系不大。
For instance, a financially irresponsible person doesn't  become  a  millionaire  by  winning  $1  million. 
例如，一个在经济上不负责任的人不会因为赢得100万美元而成为百万富翁。
He  merely  becomes  a financially irresponsible person with $1 million, and eventually the lucky money will be gone. 
他只不过是一个拿着100万美元在经济上不负责任的人，最终那笔幸运钱会消失。
A person becomes a millionaire by becoming the sort of person who "deserves" $1 million. 
一个人成为百万富翁是因为他是那种“应得”一百万美元的人。
He keeps it by being the sort of person that does not risk it, or he loses it by engaging in risky business. 
他保持这种状态是因为他是那种不冒风险的人，或者是因为从事风险业务而失去了这种状态。
In the latter case, he'll likely quickly reacquire the money by starting another business, though. 
不过，在后一种情况下，他可能会很快通过开办另一家企业东山再起。

The statement that people end up where they deserve does not  imply  any moral judgment, nor does it imply any form of entitlement. 
关于人们最终应该得到什么的说法并不意味着任何道德判断，也不意味着任何形式的权利。
In particular, it's not meant in the modern marketing sense, that people "deserve" anything they can imagine. 
特别是，这并不意味着在现代营销意义上，人们“应该”得到他们所能想象的任何东西。
Rather,  it  means  that  attitudes  combined  with  actions  lead  to  habits which, over time, tend to deliver certain deserved outcomes. 
相反，这意味着态度与行动相结合会形成习惯，随着时间的推移，习惯往往会带来某些应得的结果。
The mathematical term  for  this  property  or  statistical  connection  is  ergodicity. 
这个属性或统计学术语是遍历性。
In  popular psychology,  it's  known  by  various  other  names  such  as  positive  thinking, synchronicity,  and  praying. 
在流行心理学中，它被称为积极思维、同步性和祈祷。
These  concepts  are  often  described  as  magical thinking because the new habitual actions which result from mentally focusing on a goal and the statistical connection with the actual outcome go unseen. 
这些概念通常被描述为神奇思维，因为精神上专注于一个目标，使实际结果和行为习惯间的统计学关联是看不见的。
This doesn't mean these methods don't work; they do, but not for the reasons their believers promote. 
这并不意味着这些方法不起作用；他们起作用，但不是因为他们的信徒所提倡的原因。
However, understanding that they work due to the aggregate effect  of  many  small  but  congruent  actions,  and  using  this  understanding methodically, makes transitions more effective. 
然而，了解到它们是由于许多小而一致的动作的聚合效应而起作用的，并且有条不紊地使用这种理解，使得转换更加有效。
As an aside, it's interesting to note that the popularity of these books and methods increase if they also make the untrue statement that you can have whatever you want merely by wishing for it to come true. 
顺便说一句，有趣的是，即使这些书做出不真实的陈述，而你希望可以得到你想要的任何东西，那么它们的受欢迎程度也会增加。
This only holds during periods of prosperity, as "a rising tide lifts all  boats."  It  is,  therefore,  not  surprising  that  such  books  sell  mainly  during economic  boom  times. 
这只适用于繁荣时期，因为“涨潮会把所有船都会浮起来”因此，这类书籍主要在经济繁荣时期销售也并不奇怪。
Yet  while  there  is  no  physical  connection  between wishing  for  something  and  actually  achieving  it,  there's  no  denying  that  by making something a priority and constantly thinking about it, you will influence your actions. 
然而，尽管渴望某样东西和实际实现它之间没有物理上的联系，但不可否认的是，将某样东西作为优先事项并不断思考，会影响你的行动。
There are two additional ingredients to this: First, you must pick the  right  actions;  second,  your  vision must  lead  to  a  mission--that  is,  actions must be initiated. 
有两个额外的成分：第一，你必须选择正确的行动；第二，你的愿景必须导向一个任务——也就是说，必须开始行动。
To give an example of the wrong way to go about it, imagine that your dream is to become a millionaire--a very common dream, to be sure. 
举一个错误的例子，想象一下你的梦想是成为百万富翁——当然，这是一个非常普通的梦想。
The wrong way to dream about the million dollars is obviously thinking about what you're going to spend the money on once you have it. 
梦想百万美元的错误方式显然是考虑一旦你拥有了它，你会把钱花在什么上面。
If you dream like that for  too  long,  soon  you'll  find  yourself  spending  money  you  don't  have  yet, rationalizing that it's okay, because you'll have it someday (many student loans are spent along this line of thinking). 
如果你这样梦想太久，很快你就会发现自己花掉了你还没有的钱，这是合理的，因为总有一天你会得到它（很多学生贷款都是按照这一思路花掉的）。
The right way is to realize that in order to become a millionaire, you must earn at least $1 million more than you spend. 
正确的方法是认识到，要想成为百万富翁，你必须比你的花费多挣至少100万美元。
Your every thought should therefore be about how you can a) earn more money and b) spend less money. 
因此，你的每一个想法都应该是关于如何a）赚更多的钱和b）花更少的钱。
Since $1 million is a lot more than many people earn, the  majority  of  your  thoughts  must  revolve  around  how  to  earn  more  money rather  than  how  to  spend  less. 
由于100万美元比许多人赚的多得多，你的大部分想法必须围绕着如何赚更多的钱，而不是如何花更少的钱。
Conversely,  my  dream  was  financial independence,  which  means  that  investment  income  safely  covers  expenses. 
相反，我的梦想是财务独立，这意味着投资收入可以安全地覆盖开支。
Hence,  I  spent  most  of  my  time  thinking  about  how  I  could  a)  lower  my expenses  and  b)  increase  my  investment  income. 
因此，我花了大部分时间思考如何a）降低开支，b）增加投资收入。
Hence,  I  didn't  have  a particular  net  worth  in  mind,  nor  did  I  think  particularly  hard  about  ways  to make more money.
因此，我心中没有一个特定的净值，也没有特别认真地思考如何赚更多的钱。
