It  is  possible  to  change  "species."   Regardless  of  the  initial  state  or  large bumps  along  the  way,  people  gravitate  toward  the  outcomes  their  behavior induces. 

As  "species"  have  different  types  of  behavior,  one  must  change behavior to change species. 

There's no faking it, nor is there any "buying" it. 

People do not change due to a single clever idea; they are what they are based on the totality of their behavior. 

In other words, luck is only important in the short term. 

In the long term, luck has little to do with success. 

For instance, a financially irresponsible person doesn't  become  a  millionaire  by  winning  $1  million. 

He  merely  becomes  a financially irresponsible person with $1 million, and eventually the lucky money will be gone. 

A person becomes a millionaire by becoming the sort of person who "deserves" $1 million. 

He keeps it by being the sort of person that does not risk it, or he loses it by engaging in risky business. 

In the latter case, he'll likely quickly reacquire the money by starting another business, though. 

The statement that people end up where they deserve does not  imply  any moral judgment, nor does it imply any form of entitlement. 

In particular, it's not meant in the modern marketing sense, that people "deserve" anything they can imagine. 

Rather,  it  means  that  attitudes  combined  with  actions  lead  to  habits which, over time, tend to deliver certain deserved outcomes. 

The mathematical term  for  this  property  or  statistical  connection  is  ergodicity. 

In  popular psychology,  it's  known  by  various  other  names  such  as  positive  thinking, synchronicity,  and  praying. 

These  concepts  are  often  described  as  magical thinking because the new habitual actions which result from mentally focusing on a goal and the statistical connection with the actual outcome go unseen. 

This doesn't mean these methods don't work; they do, but not for the reasons their believers promote. 

However, understanding that they work due to the aggregate effect  of  many  small  but  congruent  actions,  and  using  this  understanding methodically, makes transitions more effective. 

As an aside, it's interesting to note that the popularity of these books and methods increase if they also make the untrue statement that you can have whatever you want merely by wishing for it to come true. 

This only holds during periods of prosperity, as "a rising tide lifts all  boats."  It  is,  therefore,  not  surprising  that  such  books  sell  mainly  during economic  boom  times. 

Yet  while  there  is  no  physical  connection  between wishing  for  something  and  actually  achieving  it,  there's  no  denying  that  by making something a priority and constantly thinking about it, you will influence your actions. 

There are two additional ingredients to this: First, you must pick the  right  actions;  second,  your  vision must  lead  to  a  mission--that  is,  actions must be initiated. 

To give an example of the wrong way to go about it, imagine that your dream is to become a millionaire--a very common dream, to be sure. 

The wrong way to dream about the million dollars is obviously thinking about what you're going to spend the money on once you have it. 

If you dream like that for  too  long,  soon  you'll  find  yourself  spending  money  you  don't  have  yet, rationalizing that it's okay, because you'll have it someday (many student loans are spent along this line of thinking). 

The right way is to realize that in order to become a millionaire, you must earn at least $1 million more than you spend. 

Your every thought should therefore be about how you can a) earn more money and b) spend less money. 

Since $1 million is a lot more than many people earn, the  majority  of  your  thoughts  must  revolve  around  how  to  earn  more  money rather  than  how  to  spend  less. 

Conversely,  my  dream  was  financial independence,  which  means  that  investment  income  safely  covers  expenses. 

Hence,  I  spent  most  of  my  time  thinking  about  how  I  could  a)  lower  my expenses  and  b)  increase  my  investment  income. 

Hence,  I  didn't  have  a particular  net  worth  in  mind,  nor  did  I  think  particularly  hard  about  ways  to make more money.
