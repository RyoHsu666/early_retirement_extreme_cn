If things have some use value but a price close to zero, such as old clothes, garden hoses, or a rusty but working bicycle, they can be given away.

There are several systems for this, depending on where you live.

One can donate the things to thrift stores, charities, or religious institutions, which may be tax-deductible.

One can put them out on the sidewalk with a sign saying "FREE.

" The method I like  best,  though,  is  freecycling.

Freecycling  is  organized  through  an  Internet mailing  list.

People  post  things  they  have  and  things  they  want,  and  others respond.

Once  a  connection  has  been  made,  the  owner/donor  simply  puts  the thing outside the front door and tells the recipient where to pick it up.

When giving things away, consider city-city  or  even state-state arbitrage of goods  between  areas  with  high  and  low  costs  of  living.

It  may  be  helpful  to transport  it  to  a  cheaper  place,  which  may  be  the  next,  smaller  city.

Here  the recipients  may  gratefully  accept  your  $125  used  chair,  whereas  in  the "expensive" city they may be dealing in $250 chairs and scoff at your $125 chair.
