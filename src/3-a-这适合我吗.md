The  methods  presented  in  this  book  don't  rely  on  a  combination  of  risky
techniques  coupled  with  once-in-a-lifetime  opportunities  such  as  bull  market
investment returns or leveraged or correctly timed real estate speculation, all of
which are hard to replicate. While such methods are interesting to read about,
they fall into the high-risk/high-return, personal anecdote category, where only a
few  people  win.  Also,  typically,  when  books  describing  such  opportunities
finally  come  out,  it's  too  late  to  implement  their  methods,  as  the  market  has
already peaked.
In this book (and in my life) I have chosen to rely on methods that work
regardless  of  external  circumstances,  as  long  as  your  country  has  a  market
economy and does not force anyone to work. However, as mentioned above, just
because the methods are universally applicable, it doesn't mean that everybody
will adopt them and follow through. This book is, after all, about leaving Plato's
Cave and prescribes a lifestyle makeover rather than simple, quick fixes to patch
the problems of other lifestyles. To use a sports analogy, this book will teach you
how to think and work out like an athlete so that you can become an athlete,
rather  than  present  a  few  easy  workouts  to  lose  a  few  pounds  and  "get  into
shape" before the beach season begins.
It might be helpful for readers to get an idea of whether they're ready to leave
the  cave.  What  follows  are  a  few  questions  which  might  indicate  whether
someone is a good fit for the proposed changes.
Are you completely happy with your life?
This question is important for anyone contemplating change. Anyone who
thinks their life perfect is unlikely to want to change anything. However,
perhaps you're not completely satisfied with your life, or maybe the way the
world works doesn't quite make sense to you. For instance, why do we still
work eight hours a day, 50 weeks a year, when we're twice as productive as
we were 50 years ago? Why do we have children, then send them away for
most of the day shortly after they're born? Is there more to life than more
work and more stuff? Can happiness be bought?
Do you want to live on a solid foundation?
Many  people  get  married,  start  a  family,  or  buy  a  home  without  a  solid
financial foundation based on savings. Instead they borrow heavily hoping
to  make  up  the  difference  later.  This  can  easily  turn  into  a  lifetime  of
struggling to make ends meet because such a large fraction of the income
goes towards paying interest on past consumption when it instead could be
used to live better. For example, people could work less and spend more
time with each other. A good financial foundation allows parents to raise
their own children instead  of  outsourcing the  job  to  daycare  centers  and
babysitters. A good financial foundation allows people to spend more time
working on things they want to work on instead of working on things they
have to work on to pay the bills. In general, financial independence creates
much more flexibility and allows a greater choice of how one lives.
Do you want to start a business?
Being financially independent you can take risks with your time to focus on
projects which don't require an immediate payout to justify your effort. If
successful, working for yourself can be more remunerative than working
for others, because you receive the full benefit of your efforts. The biggest
cost of a startup is often the salary you need to pay yourself to live. Not
having to pay this out of company funds allows you to invest the money
back into the company. In addition, you can focus all your effort on the
company instead of working other jobs to support yourself.
Do you dream of doing instead of having things?
Is your job getting in the way of doing what you want to do? Nobody lives
forever and sooner or later people realize that their lifespan is finite and that
someday they're going to die. This revelation occurs retrospectively when
people hit their forties and ponder what they've done with their life so far.
It's called a mid-life crisis. The question you need to answer is what you
want  to  do  with  your  life  given  that  you  don't  have  the  time  to  do
everything? Do you want to spend most of your life paying off the interest
of  a  30-year  mortgage  and  working  so  you  can  fill  increasingly  bigger
houses  with  increasingly  more  stuff  while  being  stuck  in  your  daily
commute in increasingly nicer cars? Or are you prepared to give up the stuff
so  that  you  can  do  whatever  you  want,  whenever,  and  wherever,  within
reason? What will your legacy be--what you owned or who you were?
Do you believe life is an adventure?
The average man leads a predictable, some would say boring, life. He is
expected  to  get  a  college  degree  and  a  career,  buy  the  things  that  are
advertised on TV, get married and have children, and then get a mortgage
and a retirement plan. Our culture of conformity doesn't allow much choice.
Do you find it difficult to accept this constraint of choice? Do you find it
difficult to pursue your passions when you have to hold onto a full-time job
to pay all the bills? Does your job zap your creative energies? Many people
particularly  young  people,  are  starting  to  realize  that  the  pursuit  of
happiness isn't found through the pursuit of accumulating things. They don't
drop  out,  they  opt  out  and  forge  their  own  path,  starting  up  Internet
companies, traveling the world, and retiring early from the rat race so they
can  spend  their  lives  living  rather  than  just  buying  stuff.  Which  do  you
prefer?
Do you want to make a difference?
The "system," which many of us like to blame our problems on and yet
count on for our solutions, is not really governed by a mysterious group
referred to as "them." The world that we live in is the aggregate sum of the
individual behavior of all of us. "They" are not responsible for our world.
We are! You are! Unless you are a dictator, a rock star, or another person
with  enough  influence  to  facilitate  a  top-down  approach  with  decrees  or
manifestos,  the  most  effective  change  starts  with  individuals  using  a
bottom-up approach. You have to become the change you want to see. You
have to set an example for other people to follow. If you're not part of the
solution,  you're  part  of  the  problem.  Unfortunately,  many  people  in  our
culture are part of the problem. We're concerned about our dependence on
oil imports and the resulting wars, yet we drive 30 miles to work every day
to pay the bills. We're very much locked into an economic and behavioral
model that conflicts with our values. What other choice do we have? Well,
read on!
Society offers you a deal: Get a student loan; get a college degree;  get  a
mortgage and become a homeowner; build your life with a deck of credit cards.
Just sign on the dotted line and before you know it, you're on the hook for a
house, a car, the basic "human needs" of cable TV, fancy restaurant visits, cell
phone and gym subscriptions, and a house full of toys. After a few years, it'll be
hard to imagine life without all that stuff. You will, therefore, spend all your life
working  in  a  possibly  unfulfilling  job  to  pay  the  bills  for  all  the  things  you
signed up for. If your job brings you down, you buy something on credit as a
reward, dragging you further into the spiral of addiction. You'll be living in a
virtual debtor's prison, except you'll only see the bars if you miss a payment. If
you have debt, you're not a free person. You're explicitly owned by your debt
and  implicitly  owned  by  the  creditor.  You  put  15%  of  your  income  into  a
retirement  account  for  40  years,  plan  to  retire  at  65,  then  try  to  spend  the
remainder of your life making up for lost time and health. Are you willing to
take that deal? If not, there's another way: Don't accept the chains; leave the
cave.

Changing your frame of mind is key to escaping, but change is a challenge.
This challenge can become a struggle if your frame of mind is incompatible with
your adopted lifestyle. In other words, you need to believe in your lifestyle as an
end  rather  than  as  a  means  to  an  end.  To  wit,  runners  and  other  athletes
sometimes  get  the  reverse  cum  hoc  ergo  propter  hoc  comment  that  they're
already fit, so they don't need to exercise. Yet their diligent exercising is exactly
what  causes  their  fitness.  How  is  doing  good,  creating  wealth,  establishing
connections--in short, accomplishing anything--any different?
Accomplishing something is more effective with a theory that is compatible
with your reality. Such a theory must, like all theories, be built on principles that
have been developed from understanding the patterns in observed facts. Here I
seek to produce a map rather than a set of directions. Directions are succinct and
useful  until  you  get  lost  or  need  to  change  your  plans.  Maps  allow  for
optimization  and  the  freedom  to  choose  your  destination,  but  they  require
navigational skills.
To  navigate  a  map,  you  must  first  understand  your  present  environment
objectively;  that  is,  your  reality  must  match  the  reality.  It  would  not  be  an
exaggeration to say that anyone who has been brought up in our modern way of
life knows very little about their environment, except a few particular details
they need to operate some machine in a job, push papers around a bureaucracy,
or manage those who do so. A broad view of the world is therefore described in
The  lock-in.  You  must  then  understand  how  your  environment,  your  present
position, and your destination relate to the map. You must understand how your
environment affects your choices as well as your motivation for choosing. This
is described in Economic degrees of freedom. To get somewhere you must have
a  deliberate  purpose  in  mind  and  a  vision of  the  destination  that  drives  your
actions. This vision is described in The renaissance ideal. To make deliberate
choices, you must know how to creatively deal with your environment. Strategic
choices  relate  present  actions  to  future  actions.  A  set  of  general  strategies  or
guiding principles for maximizing utility and efficiency according to your values
is  given  in  Strategy,  tactics,  and  guiding  principles.  Individual  examples  of
tactics are given in A renaissance lifestyle. Since everybody's situation and goals
are unique, these are intended more as examples that illustrate the principles of
the previous chapters than as actionable to-do lists. Foundations of economics
and  finance  discusses  financial  independence  and  extreme  early  retirement.
There is tremendous confusion as to what extreme early retirement means, most
likely because only a minority of extreme early retires choose to replicate the
lifestyle--usually an endless vacation--of those who defer their retirement to old
age.

This book gives you the tools and shows you how to use them. However, it
can't give you experience in using them, nor can it give you the courage to do it;
that is up to you
