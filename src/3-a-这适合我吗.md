The  methods  presented  in  this  book  don't  rely  on  a  combination  of  risky techniques  coupled  with  once-in-a-lifetime  opportunities  such  as  bull  market investment returns or leveraged or correctly timed real estate speculation, all of which are hard to replicate. 
本书中介绍的方法，不依赖于风险技术与千载难逢的机会的组合（如牛市投资回报，或杠杆，或正确时机的房地产投机），所有上述这些都难以复制。


While such methods are interesting to read about, they fall into the high-risk/high-return, personal anecdote category, where only a few  people  win. 

虽然这些方法读起来很有趣，但它们属于高风险/高回报的个人轶事类别，只有少数人获胜。

 Also,  typically,  when  books  describing  such  opportunities finally  come  out,  it's  too  late  to  implement  their  methods,  as  the  market  has already peaked.
此外，通常情况下，当描述此类机会的书籍问世时，实施他们的方法为时已晚，因为市场已经见顶。

In this book (and in my life) I have chosen to rely on methods that work regardless  of  external  circumstances,  as  long  as  your  country  has  a  market economy and does not force anyone to work. 
在这本书中（以及在我的生活中），只要你的国家是市场经济，且不强迫任何人工作，这些方法不管外部环境如何就都行得通。


However, as mentioned above, just because the methods are universally applicable, it doesn't mean that everybody will adopt them and follow through. 
但是，如上所述，仅仅因为方法具有普遍适用性，但并不意味着每个人都会采用，并遵循它们。


This book is, after all, about leaving Plato's Cave and prescribes a lifestyle makeover rather than simple, quick fixes to patch the problems of other lifestyles. 
毕竟，这本书是关于离开柏拉图洞穴，并规定了一种生活方式的改造，而不是简单、快速的修补生活方式问题的方法。


To use a sports analogy, this book will teach you how to think and work out like an athlete so that you can become an athlete, rather  than  present  a  few  easy  workouts  to  lose  a  few  pounds  and  "get  into shape" before the beach season begins.
用运动类比，这本书将教你如何像运动员一样思考和锻炼，这样你就可以成为一名运动员，而不是在海滩季节开始之前，提供一些简单的锻炼来减掉几磅“塑身”。


It might be helpful for readers to get an idea of whether they're ready to leave the  cave. 
这对读者了解他们自己，是否准备好离开洞穴，会有所帮助。


 What  follows  are  a  few  questions  which  might  indicate  whether someone is a good fit for the proposed changes.
以下是一些问题，可能表明某人是否适合这些更改提议。


Are you completely happy with your life?
## 你对你的生活完全满意吗？

This question is important for anyone contemplating change. 
这个问题，对于任何考虑改变的人都很重要。

Anyone who thinks their life perfect is unlikely to want to change anything. 

任何认为自己生活完美的人，都不太想要做任何改变。

However, perhaps you're not completely satisfied with your life, or maybe the way the world works doesn't quite make sense to you. 

然而，也许你对自己的生活并不完全满意，或者世界的运作方式，对你来说并没意义。

For instance, why do we still work eight hours a day, 50 weeks a year, when we're twice as productive as we were 50 years ago?

例如，当我们的工作效率是 50 年前的两倍时，为什么我们仍然每天工作 8 小时，每年工作 50 周？

 Why do we have children, then send them away for most of the day shortly after they're born? 
 
为什么我们要有孩子，然后在他们出生后不久就将他们送走？ 
 
 Is there more to life than more work and more stuff?
 
  Can happiness be bought?

除了更多的工作和更多的东西，生活还有更多意义吗？
 
幸福可以买来吗？

Do you want to live on a solid foundation?
## 你想生活在一个坚实的基础上吗？

Many  people  get  married,  start  a  family,  or  buy  a  home  without  a  solid financial foundation based on savings. 

许多人结婚、组建家庭或购买房屋，但没有基于储蓄的坚实财务基础。

Instead they borrow heavily hoping to  make  up  the  difference  later. 

相反，他们大量借款，希望以后能弥补差额。

 This  can  easily  turn  into  a  lifetime  of struggling to make ends meet because such a large fraction of the income goes towards paying interest on past consumption when it instead could be used to live better. 

这很容易变成，一生为维持生计而奋斗，因为收入的很大一部分，用于支付过去消费的利息，而这些利息本来可以用来改善生活。

For example, people could work less and spend more time with each other. 
例如，人们可以减少工作，然后花更多的时间彼此相处。


A good financial foundation allows parents to raise their own children instead  of  outsourcing the  job  to  daycare  centers  and babysitters. 

良好的财务基础允许父母抚养自己的孩子，而不是将工作外包给日托中心或保姆。

A good financial foundation allows people to spend more time working on things they want to work on instead of working on things they have to work on to pay the bills. 

良好的财务基础，可以让人们将更多时间，花在他们想要做的事情上，而不是必须工作来支付账单。


In general, financial independence creates much more flexibility and allows a greater choice of how one lives.

总的来说，财务独立创造了更大的灵活性，并允许人们对生活方式有更多选择。


Do you want to start a business?
Being financially independent you can take risks with your time to focus on projects which don't require an immediate payout to justify your effort. 

## 你想创业吗？
财务独立后，你可以冒险花时间专注于你的项目，而不需要立即获得支付，来证明你的努力是合理的。

If successful, working for yourself can be more remunerative than working for others, because you receive the full benefit of your efforts. 

如果成功了，为自己工作可能比为他人工作更有回报，因为你会从自己的努力中获得全部收益。

The biggest cost of a startup is often the salary you need to pay yourself to live. 
创业的最大成本，通常是你需要支付给自己生活的薪水。


Not having to pay this out of company funds allows you to invest the money back into the company. 
不必从公司资金中支付这笔钱，你就可以将钱投资回公司。


In addition, you can focus all your effort on the company instead of working other jobs to support yourself.
此外，你可以将所有精力集中在公司上，而不是从事其他工作来养活自己。

Do you dream of doing instead of having things?
Is your job getting in the way of doing what you want to do? Nobody lives forever and sooner or later people realize that their lifespan is finite and that someday they're going to die. 

## 你梦想做一些事，而不是拥有一堆东西吗？
你的工作是否妨碍你做你想做的事？ 没有人会永远活着，人们迟早会意识到他们的寿命是有限的，总有一天他们会死。

This revelation occurs retrospectively when people hit their forties and ponder what they've done with their life so far.
It's called a mid-life crisis. 

当人们四十多岁时，思考迄今为止他们的生活，和所做的事情时，这种启示就会出现。
这就是所谓的中年危机。

The question you need to answer is what you want  to  do  with  your  life  given  that  you  don't  have  the  time  to  do everything? 

你需要回答的问题是，鉴于你没有时间做所有事情，你想用自己的生活做什么？

Do you want to spend most of your life paying off the interest of  a  30-year  mortgage  and  working  so  you  can  fill  increasingly  bigger houses  with  increasingly  more  stuff  while  being  stuck  in  your  daily commute in increasingly nicer cars?

你是否想用一生的大部分时间，为偿还 30 年期抵押贷款的利息而工作，这样你就可以用越来越多的东西，填满越来越大的房子，在日常通勤中，又被困在越来越好的汽车上？

 Or are you prepared to give up the stuff so  that  you  can  do  whatever  you  want,  whenever,  and  wherever,  within reason?
或者你准备放弃这一切，而是做任何你想做的事情，随时，随地，没有理由？

 What will your legacy be--what you owned or who you were?

你的遗产会是什么，你拥有什么，你是谁？

Do you believe life is an adventure?

## 你相信人生是一场冒险吗？

The average man leads a predictable, some would say boring, life. 

普通人过着可预测的，但有些人会说无聊的，生活。

He is expected  to  get  a  college  degree  and  a  career,  buy  the  things  that  are advertised on TV, get married and have children, and then get a mortgage and a retirement plan. 

他期待着获得大学学位和职业，购买电视广告中的东西，结婚生子，然后获得贷款和一个退休计划。

Our culture of conformity doesn't allow much choice.
Do you find it difficult to accept this constraint of choice? 

我们的从众文化不允许太多选择。
你是否觉得难以接受这种选择约束？

Do you find it difficult to pursue your passions when you have to hold onto a full-time job to pay all the bills? 
当你不得不保住一份全职工作，来支付所有账单时，你是否觉得很难追求自己的热情？

Does your job zap your creative energies? 
你的工作会消耗你的创造力吗？

Many people particularly  young  people,  are  starting  to  realize  that  the  pursuit  of happiness isn't found through the pursuit of accumulating things. 
很多人，尤其是年轻人，开始意识到，幸福不是靠积累东西来实现的。


They don't drop  out,  they  opt  out  and  forge  their  own  path,  starting  up  Internet companies, traveling the world, and retiring early from the rat race so they can  spend  their  lives  living  rather  than  just  buying  stuff. 
他们没有退出，他们选择退出，开辟自己的道路，创办互联网公司，环游世界，从激烈的竞争中提早退休，这样他们就可以过上自己的生活，而不仅仅是买东西。

Which  do  youprefer?
Do you want to make a difference?
你喜欢哪个？

## 你想有所作为吗？

The "system," which many of us like to blame our problems on and yet count on for our solutions, is not really governed by a mysterious group referred to as "them." The world that we live in is the aggregate sum of the individual behavior of all of us. 

我们中许多人喜欢将问题归咎于“系统”，但又指望“系统”为我们提供解决方案，实际上“系统”并不是由一个被称为“他们”的神秘团体所管理的。
我们生活的世界，是我们所有人个人行为的总和。


"They" are not responsible for our world.
We are! You are! Unless you are a dictator, a rock star, or another person with  enough  influence  to  facilitate  a  top-down  approach  with  decrees  or manifestos,  the  most  effective  change  starts  with  individuals  using  a bottom-up approach. 

“他们”不对我们的世界负责。
我们是！ 你是！ 除非你是独裁者、摇滚明星或其他有足够影响力的人，可以通过法令或者宣言促进自上而下的改革，否则最有效的改变，是始于使用自下而上方法的个人。

You have to become the change you want to see. 

你必须成为你想看到的改变。


You have to set an example for other people to follow. 

你必须为其他人树立榜样。

If you're not part of the solution,  you're  part  of  the  problem. 
如果你不是解决方案的一部分，那么你就是问题的一部分。


 Unfortunately,  many  people  in  our culture are part of the problem. 
不幸的是，我们文化中的许多人都是问题的一部分。


We're concerned about our dependence on oil imports and the resulting wars, yet we drive 30 miles to work every day to pay the bills. 

我们担心对石油进口的依赖，并由此产生战争，但我们每天开车 30 英里去上班，来支付账单。

We're very much locked into an economic and behavioral model that conflicts with our values. 

我们受困于一种，与我们的价值观相冲突的，经济和行为模式。

What other choice do we have? Well, read on!
我们还有什么选择？ 好吧，继续阅读！

Society offers you a deal: Get a student loan; get a college degree;  get  a mortgage and become a homeowner; build your life with a deck of credit cards.
社会为你提供交易：获得学生贷款； 获得大学学位； 获得抵押贷款并成为房主； 用一张信用卡建立你的生活。

Just sign on the dotted line and before you know it, you're on the hook for a house, a car, the basic "human needs" of cable TV, fancy restaurant visits, cell phone and gym subscriptions, and a house full of toys. 
只需在虚线上签名，不知不觉中，你就已经关联了一辆车、有线电视这些基本的“人类需求”、高档餐厅、手机和健身房会员，和一所充满玩具的房子。


After a few years, it'll be hard to imagine life without all that stuff. 
几年后，就很难想象没有这些东西的生活了。


You will, therefore, spend all your life working  in  a  possibly  unfulfilling  job  to  pay  the  bills  for  all  the  things  you signed up for. 
因此，你将终生从事一项可能无法令人满意的工作，以支付你签下的所有账单。


If your job brings you down, you buy something on credit as a reward, dragging you further into the spiral of addiction. 
如果你的工作让你失望，你会赊账买东西作为奖励，这会让你进一步陷入成瘾的漩涡。


You'll be living in a virtual debtor's prison, except you'll only see the bars if you miss a payment. 
你将生活在虚拟债务人的监狱中，只有你在错过付款时才会看到栏杆。


If you have debt, you're not a free person. 

如果你有债务，你就不是一个自由的人。

You're explicitly owned by your debt and  implicitly  owned  by  the  creditor. 
你明确地由你的债务拥有，而隐含地由债权人拥有。


 You  put  15%  of  your  income  into  a retirement  account  for  40  years,  plan  to  retire  at  65,  then  try  to  spend  the remainder of your life making up for lost time and health. 
你将收入的 15% 存入退休账户 40 年，计划在 65 岁退休，然后尝试用余生来弥补失去的时间和健康。


Are you willing to take that deal? If not, there's another way: Don't accept the chains; leave the cave.

你愿意接受这笔交易吗？ 如果不愿意，还有另一种方式：不要接受锁链，离开洞穴。


Changing your frame of mind is key to escaping, but change is a challenge.
改变思维模式是逃离的关键，但改变是一个挑战。

This challenge can become a struggle if your frame of mind is incompatible with your adopted lifestyle. 

如果你的思维模式，与你的生活方式不相容，那么这个挑战可能会变成一场斗争。


In other words, you need to believe in your lifestyle as an
end  rather  than  as  a  means  to  an  end. 

换句话说，你需要相信你的生活方式是目的，而不是达到目的的手段。

 To  wit,  runners  and  other  athletes sometimes  get  the  reverse  cum  hoc  ergo  propter  hoc  comment  that  they're already fit, so they don't need to exercise. 

也就是说，跑步者和其他运动员已经很健康了，所以他们不需要锻炼。

Yet their diligent exercising is exactly what  causes  their  fitness. 
然而，他们勤奋的锻炼正是他们健康的原因。


 How  is  doing  good,  creating  wealth,  establishing connections--in short, accomplishing anything--any different?

做好事、创造财富、建立联系——简而言之，完成任何事情——有什么不同？

Accomplishing something is more effective with a theory that is compatible with your reality. 

使用与你的现实相符的理论，来完成某事时会更有效。

Such a theory must, like all theories, be built on principles that have been developed from understanding the patterns in observed facts. 
像所有理论一样，这样的理论必须建立在这样的原则上，通过理解观察到的事实发展起来。


Here I seek to produce a map rather than a set of directions. 
在这里，我试图制作一张地图而不是一组方向。


Directions are succinct and useful  until  you  get  lost  or  need  to  change  your  plans. 

路线简洁而有用，直到你迷路或需要更改计划。

 Maps  allow  for optimization  and  the  freedom  to  choose  your  destination,  but  they  require navigational skills.

地图允许优化和自由选择目的地，但它们需要导航技能。

To  navigate  a  map,  you  must  first  understand  your  present  environment objectively;  that  is,  your  reality  must  match  the  reality. 
要在地图上导航，你必须首先客观地了解你当前的环境； 也就是说，你的现实必须与现实相匹配。


 It  would  not  be  an exaggeration to say that anyone who has been brought up in our modern way of life knows very little about their environment, except a few particular details they need to operate some machine in a job, push papers around a bureaucracy, or manage those who do so. 
可以毫不夸张地说，任何在我们现代生活方式中长大的人，都对他们的环境知之甚少，除了一些特定的细节，如需要他们在工作中操作某些机器，官僚机构里传送的文件，或者管理这些人这么做的人。


A broad view of the world is therefore described in The  lock-in. 
在[锁住]()中描述了一个广阔的画面。


 You  must  then  understand  how  your  environment,  your  present position, and your destination relate to the map. 

然后，你必须了解你的环境、你当前的位置、你的目的地与地图的关系。

You must understand how your environment affects your choices as well as your motivation for choosing. 

你必须了解环境如何影响你的选择，以及你选择的动机。

This is described in Economic degrees of freedom. 

这在[经济上的自由度]()中有描述。

To get somewhere you must have a  deliberate  purpose  in  mind  and  a  vision of  the  destination  that  drives  your actions. 

为了到达某个地方，你必须有一个深思熟虑的目的，和驱动你行动的愿景。


This vision is described in The renaissance ideal. 
这一愿景在[文艺复兴式的理念]中有描述。


To make deliberate choices, you must know how to creatively deal with your environment. 
要做出深思熟虑的选择，你必须知道如何创造性地处理你周围的环境。


Strategic choices  relate  present  actions  to  future  actions. 

战略选择将当前行动与未来行动联系在了一起。

 A  set  of  general  strategies  or guiding principles for maximizing utility and efficiency according to your values is  given  in  Strategy,  tactics,  and  guiding  principles. 

[策略、战术和指导原则]()中给出了一组根据你的价值观，最大化效用和效率的一般战略和指导原则。

 Individual  examples  of tactics are given in A renaissance lifestyle. 

策略的个别例子在[文艺复兴式的生活方式]中给出。

Since everybody's situation and goals are unique, these are intended more as examples that illustrate the principles of the previous chapters than as actionable to-do lists. 

由于每个人的情况和目标都是独一无二的，因此这些更多是作为说明前几章原则的示例，而不是可操作的待办事项列表。

Foundations of economics and  finance  discusses  financial  independence  and  extreme  early  retirement.

[经济和金融基础]()讨论了财务独立和极早退休。

There is tremendous confusion as to what extreme early retirement means, most likely because only a minority of extreme early retires choose to replicate the lifestyle--usually an endless vacation--of those who defer their retirement to old age.

对于极早退休的含义存在极大的困惑，这可能是因为只有少数的极早退休的人选择复制，那些将退休推迟到老年的人的生活方式——通常是无尽的假期。

This book gives you the tools and shows you how to use them. 
本书为你提供了工具，并向你展示了如何使用它们。


However, it can't give you experience in using them, nor can it give you the courage to do it; that is up to you

但是，它不能给你使用它们的经验，也不能给你这样做的勇气； 因为那完全取决于你。
