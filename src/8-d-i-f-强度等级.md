The  following  is  a  useful  gauge  for  subjective  exercise  intensity. 

Intense exercise  happens  beyond  level  7. 

I've  been  to  level  10  twice  in  my  life. 

On second  thought,  maybe  it was  only  level  9. 

While  the  levels  seem  unscientific, they  actually  correlate  rather  well  with  the  amount  of  surplus  oxygen  you  can use to talk with. 

1.  You can hold a continuous tone.
2.  You can tell your life story.
3.  You can speak in paragraphs.
4.  You can carry on a conversation.
5.  You can talk in sentences.
6.  You can speak a few words at a time.
7.  You can pronounce a syllable or two at a time.
8.  You can't possibly breathe any faster than this.
9.  You think you will die.
10.  You wish you were dead.

The  best  exercise  intensity,  in  terms  of  calories  burned  and  increase  of cardiovascular capacity,  is  right  around  the lactic  acid  threshold--that  is,  where the  body  starts  running  out  of  oxygen,  somewhere  between  level  7  and  8. 

Conversely, most aerobic workouts happen at level 4 because it burns the most fat87 relative to blood sugar, and especially because this lower level doesn't scare off the beginners, who are very important to the fitness industry.
