The  following  is  a  useful  gauge  for  subjective  exercise  intensity. 
以下是衡量主观锻炼强度的有用标准。
Intense exercise  happens  beyond  level  7. 
高强度运动超过7级。
I've  been  to  level  10  twice  in  my  life. 
我这辈子上过两次10级。
On second  thought,  maybe  it was  only  level  9. 
再想一想，也许只有9级。
While  the  levels  seem  unscientific, they  actually  correlate  rather  well  with  the  amount  of  surplus  oxygen  you  can use to talk with. 
虽然这些水平似乎不科学，但它们实际上与你可以用来交谈的剩余氧气量有相当好的相关性。
1.  You can hold a continuous tone.
2.  You can tell your life story.
3.  You can speak in paragraphs.
4.  You can carry on a conversation.
5.  You can talk in sentences.
6.  You can speak a few words at a time.
7.  You can pronounce a syllable or two at a time.
8.  You can't possibly breathe any faster than this.

1.你可以保持连续的音调。
2.你可以讲述你的人生故事。
3.你可以分段发言。
4.你可以继续对话。
5.你可以用句子说话。
6.你可以一次说几句话。
7.你一次可以发一两个音节的音。
8.你不可能呼吸得比这更快。
9.你认为你会死。
10.你希望自己死了。
The  best  exercise  intensity,  in  terms  of  calories  burned  and  increase  of cardiovascular capacity,  is  right  around  the lactic  acid  threshold--that  is,  where the  body  starts  running  out  of  oxygen,  somewhere  between  level  7  and  8. 
就燃烧的卡路里和增加心血管容量而言，最佳运动强度正好在乳酸阈值附近——也就是说，身体开始耗尽氧气，介于7到8级之间。
Conversely, most aerobic workouts happen at level 4 because it burns the most fat87 relative to blood sugar, and especially because this lower level doesn't scare off the beginners, who are very important to the fitness industry.
相反，大多数有氧运动发生在4级，因为相对于血糖，它燃烧的脂肪最多，尤其是因为这个较低的水平不会吓跑初学者，因为初学者对健身行业非常重要。
