Things  used  to  be  built  to  last.

It  was  expected  that  a  piece  of  furniture or even a good jacket could be handed down to the next generation.

With growing product quality, there was a limit to the size of the market.

As soon as everybody had everything they needed, there was no one left to sell to and businesses would have begun to shut down, leaving people with less work (gasp!).

This happened around the 1920s.

The solution was and still is to change the focus to the service aspect.

63 One contemporary example is when a $500 cell phone is  sold  for  $1, but with a mandatory $1,000 contract.

Leasing is  another  example.

However,  a more  nefarious  strategy  has  been  to  build  products  of  an  increasingly  inferior quality  and,  in  doing  so,  make  them  cheaper.

This  creates  a  continuous  and dependable  demand  as  things  break  and  are  thrown  out  and  replaced.

It  has therefore become somewhat of a challenge to "find the good stuff.

" Finding the good  stuff  can  be  done  by  exploiting  survivor  bias.

As  someone  informed  me, the  good  stuff  is  whatever  costs  more  than  $100  in  a  pawn  shop  or  an  antique store.
