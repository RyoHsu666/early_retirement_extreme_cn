Unlike  businesses,  consumers  rarely  use  debt  to  invest  and  generate  an income.
与企业不同，消费者很少利用债务进行投资和创造收入。
Instead, they use debt to purchase consumables like vehicles, houses, furniture, and electronics, which don't generate income.
相反，他们用债务购买汽车、房屋、家具和电子产品等不产生收入的消耗品。
In this case, interest is no longer the cost of doing business.
在这种情况下，利息不再是做生意的成本。
It's now the cost of living beyond one's means.
现在是一个人入不敷出的生活费用。
This cost ranges from typical mortgage rates to typical credit card rates multiplied by the outstanding debt.
这一成本范围从典型的抵押贷款利率，到典型的信用卡利率乘以未偿债务。
Over the lifetime of a consumer this adds up to substantial amounts of money.
在消费者的整个生命周期中，这意味着相当多的钱。
Consider a typical six percent mortgage that runs 30 years.
考虑一个典型的6%的30年房贷。
Here the total interest over the years is ~105% on top of the cost of the home.
在这里，这些年的总利息约为房屋成本的105%。
For those who are just starting their repayment, interest and finance charges  comprise  almost  all  of  the  monthly  payment--home  equity  is  mainly  built towards the end of the repayment.
对于那些刚刚开始还款的人来说，利息和财务费用几乎构成了每月还款的全部——房屋净值主要是在还款结束时建立的。
It's very hard to become wealthy and financially independent this way, and predominantly making interest payments is more accurately thought of as paying rent while being responsible for all the expenses associated with home ownership.
以这种方式变得富有和财务独立是非常困难的，而且支付利息应被更准确地认为是支付租金，同时承担与拥有房屋相关的所有花费。

All debt comes with a contractual obligation of repayment, which is usually structured  to  last  30  years  to  minimize  individual  monthly  payments,  but definitely not to minimize the total number of payments, which is maximized by increasing  the  maturity  of  the  loan  as  much  as  possible.
所有债务都有一个还款的合同义务，其结构通常为持续30年，以尽量减少个人每月付款，但绝对不是为了尽量减少付款总数，这是通过尽可能增加贷款到期日来实现的。
If  the  maturity  is extended in perpetuity, the interest payments become similar to rent.
如果到期日永久延长，利息支付将类似于租金。
If the only means of repayment is a job, this means that working must also last at least 30 years.
如果唯一的偿还手段是工作，这意味着工作也必须持续至少30年。
This way, a single decision just after leaving school turns into a lifelong commitment that can be very hard to escape, given that the borrowed money has been spent on increasing consumption rather than increasing production.
这样一来，毕业后的一个决定就变成了一个终生的承诺，很难逃避，因为借来的钱都花在了增加消费而不是增加产量上。

Most major consumption is financed.
大部分主要消费都是由融资支持的。
This means that money spent on major consumption  has  not  been  earned  by  those  who  spend  it.
这意味着花在主要消费上的钱并不是那些花钱的人赚来的。
This  has  a  drastic consequence for the way the market sets the price level of anything that can be financed,16 and today, anything--even a fast food meal at a burger franchise--can be  financed  through  unsecured  credit.
这对市场设定可以融资的价格产生了巨大的影响，今天，任何东西——即使是汉堡连锁店的快餐——都可以通过无担保信贷融资。
Specifically,  things  are  priced  not according  to  how  much  money  people  have  saved,  but  how  large  a  monthly payment borrowers and lenders think can be made in the future.
具体来说，东西的定价并不是根据人们存了多少钱，而是根据借款人和贷款人认为未来可以每月支付多少钱。
This is set by the interest rate, which is partially manipulated by the government, and credit ratings, which are partially manipulated by individual consumers, lenders, and credit rating agencies.
这是由利率（部分由政府操纵）和信用评级（部分由个人消费者、贷款人和信用评级机构操纵）设定的。
These facts change the way people think of money.
这些事实上改变了人们对金钱的看法。
What you have saved becomes less important than what you can potentially borrow.
你所存的东西比你能借的东西更重要。

The consequence is that the cost in terms of hours worked is no longer fully appreciated, and people work and spend more--sometimes far more--than they would if they paid cash, counting on being able to pay it back in the future or rolling over the debt, thus being forever locked in.
其结果是，以工作时间计算的成本不再得到充分的重视，人们工作更多和消费更多——有时远远高于——如果他们支付的是现金，他们指望将来能够偿还或债务叠加债务，被永远地锁住。
Many even spend so much that they can't pay it back, leading to misallocated resources which could have been spent more fairly by those who earned the money.
许多人甚至花费太多以至于无法偿还，从而导致资源分配不当，而这些资源本来可以被那些挣钱的人更公平地使用。

The systemic consequence of this waste is that prices in a debt-driven society are higher than they would be in a cash-driven society, simply because more money (credit) is chasing the goods.
这种浪费的系统性后果是，债务驱动型社会的价格高于现金驱动型社会的价格，这是因为更多的钱（信贷）在追逐商品。
This leads to bubbles and crashes due to credit being either too cheap or too expensive, and a psychological lag leading to a  bipolar  economy  of  alternating  optimism and pessimism.
这导致了泡沫和崩溃，因为信贷要么太便宜要么太贵，心理滞后导致乐观和悲观交替的两极经济。
17  It  would  appear that economists, or the effective majority of individuals who engage in lending and  borrowing,  haven't  yet  been  able  to  perfectly  model  future  demand  and supply, and thus an economy that is built on predictions of future demand and  supply  (by  the  pricing  of  future  payments  in  the  form  of  the  interest  rate)  is inherently unstable.
经济学家，或实际上大多数从事借贷的个人，尚未能够完美地模拟未来的需求和供给，因此，一个建立在未来需求和供给预测（通过利率形式的未来支付定价）基础上的经济本质上是不稳定的。

Ideally, personal finance shifts cash flows around in time so that money is available when it's most wanted and paid back when it's least wanted.
理想情况下，个人理财会及时转移现金流，以便资金在最需要的时候可用，在最不需要的时候偿还。
However, this shifting comes at a price in terms of fees and interest charges.
然而，这种转变在费用和利息方面是有代价的。
In particular, many people who don't know any better will simply make the standard choice, which  effectively  involves  contractual  obligations  to  work  all  of  their  life  in exchange for houses, vehicles, furniture, electronics, and other stuff.
特别是，许多对此一无所知的人只会做出标准选择，这实际上涉及到合同义务，即终生工作以换取房屋、车辆、家具、电子产品和其他东西。
To wit, a salary or even the potential of a future salary seems to be a gateway to the debt drug;  so  many  people  could  probably  reduce  the  risk  of  getting  into  debt  by simply quitting their jobs.
也就是说，一份薪水，甚至是未来薪水的潜力，似乎是通向债务毒品的大门；因此，许多人可以通过简单地辞掉工作来降低陷入债务的风险。
