Why do we eat the way we do? Some eat for fuel, some eat for comfort, but I bet  most  adopted  the  eating  habits  of  their  parents  rather  than  making  a deliberate choice. 

 Before I discuss why I think food should be eaten for fuel with good  taste  as  a  side  effect  rather  than  the  other  way  around,  let  me  start  by discussing eating for comfort and tradition.
