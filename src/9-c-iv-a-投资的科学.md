Economics (and investing) is often said to suffer from "physics envy", in that it  would  like  to  be  an  exact  science. 
经济学（和投资）经常被称为“物理学嫉妒”，因为它想成为一门精确的科学。
 To  do  this,  mathematics,  which  is  precise though  not  necessarily  accurate,  is  used  to  give  the  impression  of  accuracy. 
为了做到这一点，数学虽然不一定精确，但它却被用来给人以精确的印象。
Using  an  equation  is  no  substitute  for  understanding  an  equation. 
使用方程式不能代替理解方程式。
 In  fact,  an equation  isn't  a  black  box  where  one  cranks  the  handle  to  obtain  a  result.113 
 事实上，方程式并不是一个黑匣子，在黑匣子里你可以转动手柄来获得结果。
 Rather,  it's  an  idea  formulated  in  another  language  which  just  happens  to  be internally consistent, so that one idea may be transformed into another idea and remain  consistent!  In  particular,  the  limitations  of  the  equations  should  be understood--very often people make simplifying assumptions to make a problem mathematically  tractable.114  
 相反，这是一个用另一种语言表述的想法，恰好在内部是一致的，因此一个想法可以转化为另一个想法并保持一致！特别是，应该理解方程的局限性——人们通常会简化假设，使问题在数学上易于处理。
 This  works  well  in  physics  because  the  universe seems  to  be  inherently  simple. 
这在物理学中很有效，因为宇宙似乎天生就是简单的。
 It  works  poorly  when  it  comes  to  predicting behavior because people, even when treated statistically, are complex. 
它在预测行为方面效果不佳，因为人们，即使在统计处理时，也是复杂的。
Investing  is  a  skill  to  be  learned. 
投资是一项需要学习的技能。
 Copying  requires  no  skill  (see  Gauging mastery). 
复制不需要技巧（参见[衡量精通]()）。
The easiest thing to copy is the average, since there are few numbers simpler  than  the  average  to  describe  a  set. 
最容易复制的是平均数，因为描述一个集合，没有比平均数更简单的数字了。
 The  average  is  also  known  as  the market index. 
平均值也称为市场指数。
Since copying requires no effort, the cost is zero and so the return on  effort  is  undefined. 
由于复制不需要努力，因此成本为零，因此努力的回报是未定义的。
 In  particular,  "average"  is  psychologically  attractive, because  people  like  to  compare  themselves  to  others  and  a  guaranteed  average usually feels better than below average. 
特别是，“平均”在心理上是有吸引力的，因为人们喜欢把自己和别人比较，而保证的平均水平，通常比低于平均水平的感觉要好。
Staying  with  the  progression  of  mastery,  the  next  stage  is  comparing. 
随着掌握的进展，下一阶段是比较。
 A particularly  poor  (and  popular)  method  at  this  stage  is  chasing  yield,  where people compare the returns of different investments (funds, stocks, etc.) and buy whatever has recently performed the best. 
在这个阶段，一种特别差（而且流行）的方法是追逐收益率，人们比较不同投资（基金、股票等）的回报，然后购买最近表现最好的东西。
Never do that! It is akin to shooting arrows into the location where a prey was hit a few hours ago. 
永远不要那样做！这类似于向几个小时前猎物被击中的地方射箭。
The  next  level  is  compiling  (again,  see  Gauging  mastery). 
下一个级别是编译（同样，请参见[衡量精通]()）。
 Here, understanding  is  presented  as  fairly  long  lists  of  rules  or  tips  about  things  that have worked well at one point or another. 
在这里，理解是以相当长的，规则或技巧列表的形式呈现的，这些规则或技巧在某一点上很有效。
It's not yet understood why they have worked and it's difficult to choose one, plus the rules never seem to apply to a given investment all at the same time. 
目前还不清楚它们为什么会起作用，而且很难选择一种，而且这些规则似乎不能同时适用于给定的投资。
However,  having  compiled  a  list  of  rules,  one  may  use  a  "screen"  to  filter companies and even to sort them. 
然而，在编制了一系列规则之后，人们可以使用“屏幕”对公司进行筛选，甚至对其进行排序。
It's thus a simple matter to calculate, say, the top ten of the list, the bottom ten, or top twenty on a combined list. 
然后，计算列表的前十名、后十名或组合列表的前二十名，变成一件简单的事情。
This takes emotion out of the game, and many quantitative systems work on this level. 
这将情感带出游戏，许多定量系统在这个层面上工作。
This takes some effort to set up, but once it is, it can run automatically. 
这需要一些努力来设置，一旦设置完成，它就可以自动运行。
Coordinating rules requires understanding why some rules work better than others and why some only work in certain situations. 
协调规则需要理解，为什么有些规则比其他规则更有效，以及为什么有些规则只在某些情况下有效。
This is a value judgment and  a  complex  problem  which  is  mathematically  intractable. 
这是一个价值判断，也是一个复杂的数学难题。
 Still,  even  at  this level you'll be competing with other investors who are likely using some of the same rules to form their strategies. 
尽管如此，在这个水平上，你也会与其他投资者竞争，他们可能会使用一些相同的规则来制定他们的策略。
The problem with these strategies is that the market is self-correcting and so opportunities disappear even as they are created. 
这些策略的问题在于，市场是自我修正的，因此机会即使在创造的也会消失。
It's like a lake with a limited number of fishing spots. 
它就像一个湖泊，只有有限的钓鱼点。
If people start showing up at  the  same  particular  spot,  the  odds  of  catching  anything  goes  down  for  the individual fisherman. 
如果人们开始出现在同一特定地点，渔夫个体捕获东西的几率就会降低。
At the highest level there are people who create new rules, that is, they find some  aspect  of  the  market  and  the  economy  that  allows  them  to  predict  more correctly what the future price of an asset will be. 
在最高层次上，有人创造了新的规则，也就是说，他们发现了市场和经济的某些方面，使他们能够更准确地预测资产未来的价格。
Since they don't have to share their edge (fishing spot) with anyone, they can keep all the profit. 
因为他们不必与任何人分享他们的优势（钓鱼点），所以他们可以保留所有利润。
Such research requires a bright mind and a lot of work, but the rewards are high (and of course proportional  to  assets). 
这样的研究需要聪明的头脑和大量的工作，但回报是高的（当然与资产成比例）。
 Typically,  new  investment  techniques  start  at  this  level and then diffuse down to the lower stages as more and more people pick them up and reduce the former edge (in investment parlance called alpha) to volatility (in investment  parlance  called  beta). 
通常，新的投资技术从这一水平开始，然后随着越来越多的人选择它们，并将以前的优势（用投资术语称为alpha）降低为波动性（用投资术语称为beta），并最终扩散到较低的阶段。
 Various  theories  are  in  various  stages  of diffusion, with some still having an edge and others appearing to have no edge at all. 
各种理论正处于不同的传播阶段，有些理论仍有优势，而另一些理论则似乎根本没有优势。
Keep  in  mind  though  that  you  as  an  asset  manager  are  not  necessarily striving  towards  having  an  edge. 
但请记住，作为一名资产管理人，你并不一定要努力取得优势。
 Living  off  of  your  money  will  make preservation  of  principal,  keeping  up  with  inflation,  minimizing  taxes,  and providing a stipend more important than outperforming the market.
 靠你的钱生活会使你保持本金，跟上通货膨胀，减少税收，并提供比市场表现更好的津贴。
