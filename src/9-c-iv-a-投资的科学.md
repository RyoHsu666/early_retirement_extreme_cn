Economics (and investing) is often said to suffer from "physics envy", in that it  would  like  to  be  an  exact  science. 

 To  do  this,  mathematics,  which  is  precise though  not  necessarily  accurate,  is  used  to  give  the  impression  of  accuracy. 

Using  an  equation  is  no  substitute  for  understanding  an  equation. 

 In  fact,  an equation  isn't  a  black  box  where  one  cranks  the  handle  to  obtain  a  result.113 Rather,  it's  an  idea  formulated  in  another  language  which  just  happens  to  be internally consistent, so that one idea may be transformed into another idea and remain  consistent!  In  particular,  the  limitations  of  the  equations  should  be understood--very often people make simplifying assumptions to make a problem mathematically  tractable.114  This  works  well  in  physics  because  the  universe seems  to  be  inherently  simple. 

 It  works  poorly  when  it  comes  to  predicting behavior because people, even when treated statistically, are complex. 

Investing  is  a  skill  to  be  learned. 

 Copying  requires  no  skill  (see  Gauging mastery). 

The easiest thing to copy is the average, since there are few numbers simpler  than  the  average  to  describe  a  set. 

 The  average  is  also  known  as  the market index. 

Since copying requires no effort, the cost is zero and so the return on  effort  is  undefined. 

 In  particular,  "average"  is  psychologically  attractive, because  people  like  to  compare  themselves  to  others  and  a  guaranteed  average usually feels better than below average. 

Staying  with  the  progression  of  mastery,  the  next  stage  is  comparing. 

 A particularly  poor  (and  popular)  method  at  this  stage  is  chasing  yield,  where people compare the returns of different investments (funds, stocks, etc.) and buy whatever has recently performed the best. 

Never do that! It is akin to shooting arrows into the location where a prey was hit a few hours ago. 

The  next  level  is  compiling  (again,  see  Gauging  mastery). 

 Here, understanding  is  presented  as  fairly  long  lists  of  rules  or  tips  about  things  that have worked well at one point or another. 

It's not yet understood why they have worked and it's difficult to choose one, plus the rules never seem to apply to a given investment all at the same time. 

However,  having  compiled  a  list  of  rules,  one  may  use  a  "screen"  to  filter companies and even to sort them. 

It's thus a simple matter to calculate, say, the top ten of the list, the bottom ten, or top twenty on a combined list. 

This takes emotion out of the game, and many quantitative systems work on this level. 

This takes some effort to set up, but once it is, it can run automatically. 

Coordinating rules requires understanding why some rules work better than others and why some only work in certain situations. 

This is a value judgment and  a  complex  problem  which  is  mathematically  intractable. 

 Still,  even  at  this level you'll be competing with other investors who are likely using some of the same rules to form their strategies. 

The problem with these strategies is that the market is self-correcting and so opportunities disappear even as they are created. 

It's like a lake with a limited number of fishing spots. 

If people start showing up at  the  same  particular  spot,  the  odds  of  catching  anything  goes  down  for  the individual fisherman. 

At the highest level there are people who create new rules, that is, they find some  aspect  of  the  market  and  the  economy  that  allows  them  to  predict  more correctly what the future price of an asset will be. 

Since they don't have to share their edge (fishing spot) with anyone, they can keep all the profit. 

Such research requires a bright mind and a lot of work, but the rewards are high (and of course proportional  to  assets). 

 Typically,  new  investment  techniques  start  at  this  level and then diffuse down to the lower stages as more and more people pick them up and reduce the former edge (in investment parlance called alpha) to volatility (in investment  parlance  called  beta). 

 Various  theories  are  in  various  stages  of diffusion, with some still having an edge and others appearing to have no edge at all. 

Keep  in  mind  though  that  you  as  an  asset  manager  are  not  necessarily striving  towards  having  an  edge. 

 Living  off  of  your  money  will  make preservation  of  principal,  keeping  up  with  inflation,  minimizing  taxes,  and providing a stipend more important than outperforming the market.
