Oftentimes decisions are based on emotions, but until or unless you develop a sense of pleasure from not spending too much money or a sense of dread from parting  with  excessive  money  or  getting  anything  worse  than  the  best  price, emotions are not the best decision instrument.

For  grocery  shopping  and  other  regular  purchases,  use  a  maximum  price ceiling which is the lowest price you have ever seen.

Only buy at that point.

If memory  doesn't  serve  well,  use  a  notebook.

It's  easier  to  memorize  a  limited number  of  items  commonly  purchased.

This  method  is  very  powerful,  and  if followed, will always result in buying things only on sale.

I use it to guide what's for  dinner--whatever's  on  sale.

If  you  feel  really  motivated,  plot  prices  on  a weekly or monthly basis.

This should prove quite revealing.

Many things, from vegetables  to  clothing,  vary  consistently  in  price  on  an  annual  cycle.
