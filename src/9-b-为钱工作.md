Work has been defined in many different ways, the most appropriate being, "I  know  it  when  I  see  it,"  and  very  often  includes  activities  that  one  does  not want to do.
工作有许多不同的定义，最恰当的是“我看到它时就知道了”，而且经常包括人们不想做的活动。

The  best  way  to  think  of  work  is  as  a  package  which  includes  several different goals (see Contingency goal-setting), such as cash flow (see Financial cash  flow  cycles),  contributing  to  society,  personal  edification,  socializing, having  something  to  do  all  day,  etc.
最好的思考方式是将工作视为一个包含几个不同目标（见[应变目标设定]()）的包，例如现金流（见[财务现金流周期]()）、对社会的贡献、个人熏陶、社交、全天有事可做等。
(see  the  discussion  of  side  effects  in Contingency goal-setting).
（参见[应变目标设定]()中的[副作用]()讨论）。
In many cases, cash flow isn't considered the primary reason to work.
在许多情况下，现金流并不是工作的主要原因。
Many state meaning or passion as the main reason for working.
许多国家把意义或激情作为工作的主要原因。
However, even if that is the case, the cash flow to pay for stuff, which can't  be otherwise acquired due to lack of  skills or connections (see  The lock-in and  A Renaissance lifestyle), is a crucial part of work.
然而，即使是这样，支付物品的现金流也是工作的关键部分，因为缺乏技能或人脉关系（参见[锁住]()和[文艺复兴式的生活]()），这些物品无法以其他方式获得。

When cash flow comes from work, it's called earned income.
当现金流来自工作时，它被称为挣来的收入。
Earned income is  made  either  by  working  for  an  employer  or  working  at  a  business  you  own, and  it  always  requires  spending  time  and  effort.
挣来的收入要么是为雇主工作，要么是在自己的企业工作，这总是需要花费时间和精力。
Earning  income  is  therefore  a process of exchanging your time for money.
因此，赚取收入是一个用时间换取金钱的过程。
For example, suppose the actuarial tables say you have 60 years left to live, and you work 1 year in exchange for $30,000 net.
例如，假设精算表显示你还有60年的寿命，你工作一年就可以得到3万美元的净收入。
You now have 59 years left, but you also have $30,000 which you would  not  have  gotten  otherwise.
你现在还有59年的时间，但你也有3万美元。
Similarly,  you  can  exchange  more  years  for more  money.
同样，你可以用更多的年换更多的钱。
Many  exchange  most  of  their  time  for  money.
许多人把大部分时间用来换钱。
If  we  subtract  the time spent on work plus associated tasks and sleep in a 24 hour day, there's very little time left, perhaps less than 25%.
如果我们从每天24小时减去的工作及相关任务时间和睡眠时间，剩下的时间就很少了，可能不到25%。

However, money can be spent to avoid spending time directly--for example, earning $10 to buy a  cast iron  pan takes less time than building your own pan from  scratch.
然而，可以花钱来避免花时间——例如，挣10美元买一个铸铁锅比从头开始建造自己的锅花的时间要少。
Money  can  also  be  invested  to  get  more  money  to  spend,  thus avoiding having to exchange time.
钱也可以用来投资，以获得更多的钱来消费，从而避免需要交换时间。
Different arrangements define the restrictions on your time and money stream.
不同的安排会限制你的时间和资金流。
I divide them into salaried work, which covers the  typical  arrangement  of  a  salaryman  (see  The  salary  man),  and  nonsalaried work,  which  covers  the  typical  arrangements  of  a  working  man  (see  The working man) or businessman (see The businessman).
我把它们分为正式工作和临时工作，前者包括工薪人员的典型安排（见[薪资人]()），后者包括打工人（见[打工人]()）或商人（见[生意人]()）的典型安排。

Within the context of the Renaissance lifestyle (see A Renaissance lifestyle) there are three financial strategies to pursue: Intermittent work (see Intermittent work),  financial  independence (early  retirement),  or  semi-retirement  supported by  a  form  of  part-time  work  (see  Financial  independence  and  investing).
在文艺复兴式的生活（参见[文艺复兴式的生活方式]()）中，有三种财务策略可以追求：间歇工作（参见[间歇工作]()）、财务独立（提前退休）或由兼职工作支持的半退休（参见[财务独立和投资]()）。
The beauty of combining the Renaissance lifestyle with working for money is that as long as you can get and hold a job for a handful of years, the strategy is robust and practical in the sense that success relies more on internal qualities like focus, discipline,  persistence,  and  spending  behavior,  which  are  under  your  control, than on external circumstances like career or businesses success, or a lucky run in  the  real  estate  or  stock  market,  which  are  not  directly  under  your  control.
文艺复兴式时期的生活方式与为钱而工作相结合的美妙之处在于，只要你能找到一份工作并坚持几年，这一策略就是稳健而实用的，因为成功更多地依赖于内在品质，如专注、纪律、毅力和消费行为，这些品质都在你的控制之下，而不是依靠外部环境，比如事业或企业的成功，或者房地产或股市的幸运运行，这些都不是你直接控制的。
Salaried and nonsalaried work feel different from each other due to the different ways  time  is  exchanged  and  remunerated.
由于时间交换和报酬的方式不同，正式工作和临时工作感觉不同。
Very  likely  you  already  work,  so instead of starting something new, it's most convenient to keep doing whatever it is you currently do to make money, while beginning to work on ways to make yourself more economically independent and financially resilient (see A modular design).
很可能你已经在工作了，所以与其开始新的工作，不如继续做你目前正在做的任何事情来赚钱，同时开始努力让自己在经济上更独立，在财务上更有弹性（参见[模块化设计]()）。
