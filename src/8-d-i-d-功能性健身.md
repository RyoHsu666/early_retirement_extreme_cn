Functional  fitness  is  a  recent  drive  to  reintegrate  the  isolation  exercises  of regular strength training and instead focus on whole-body movements. 

It doesn't seek to build the body for appearance, but for function. 

It's perhaps the first step towards moving exercise out of the gym and reintegrating body movement with everyday life. 

For now, it still resides in gyms, most likely because it has become difficult to find enough exercise outside in the real world, where everything that previously  required  physical  work  has  been  replaced  with  internal  combustion engines, electric tools and appliances, and paper-pushing jobs to buy them. 


The gym, however, is a good place to start before venturing out in the real world and doing real things. 

It's a place of physiological preparation, where real world strength is built up using movements which are similar in form, strength, intensity,  and  work  capacity to  real  world  movements. 

For  instance,  the  clean and  jerk  corresponds  to  picking  up  an  unconscious  person,  the  vertical  row corresponds to pulling a rope, the squat corresponds to picking up a child, and the power clean corresponds to stacking sacks of corn. 

With a solid foundation in functional  fitness,  activities  like  cycling,  walking,  running,  double  digging  a garden, or doing laundry with a plunger will be quite easy in comparison. 

It'll be the equivalent of driving a powerful SUV, tow-package, hybrid, and all that. 


Being in the right shape means an enhanced ability to tolerate cold, since it depends  on  muscularity  (static)  and  work  capacity  (dynamic). 

A  high  work capacity is the ability to perform physical work as fast as possible. 

Similarly, the ability  to  tolerate  heat  depends  on  a  low  body  fat  percentage. 

If  you  never experience heat, you can carry more body fat. 

However, it's easier not to carry it and  simply  add  a  layer  of  clothes. 

The  proper  physical  conditioning  is  thus aligned with the problem of heating and cooling (see Heating and cooling). 


It's possible never to be out of breath walking up stairs or otherwise engaging in normal activities, like cycling 10 miles to work or carrying a heavy package. 

It's possible never to be sore after an activity. 

It's possible to have fun engaging in strenuous physical activities into your 60s or beyond. 

The reason that people get  weak  is  not  age;  it's  a  history  of  disuse,  a  process  many  start  right  out  of college. 

I  think  that  maintaining  this  functionally  into  old  age  will  make  life enjoyable for a long time. 

I notice that my 80-year-old grandmother, who grew up  on  a  farm,  until  recently  was  stronger  than  my  mother,  who  was  a  stay-at- home mom and is yet still stronger than my wife, who writes reports most of the day. 

This is despite the ~25-year age differences between them, but it parallels the  progression  of  my  grandmother  using  her  hands  and  a  balloon  whip,  my mother  using  her  hands  and  an  electric  mixer,  while  we  use  a  breadmaking machine. 

This trend is best reversed.
