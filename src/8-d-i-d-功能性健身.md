Functional  fitness  is  a  recent  drive  to  reintegrate  the  isolation  exercises  of regular strength training and instead focus on whole-body movements. 
功能性健身是一项近期的运动，旨在重新整合常规力量训练中的孤立训练，转而关注全身运动。
It doesn't seek to build the body for appearance, but for function. 
它不是为了外表而打造身体，而是为了功能。
It's perhaps the first step towards moving exercise out of the gym and reintegrating body movement with everyday life. 
这也许是将锻炼从健身房中转移出来，并将身体运动与日常生活重新融合的第一步。
For now, it still resides in gyms, most likely because it has become difficult to find enough exercise outside in the real world, where everything that previously  required  physical  work  has  been  replaced  with  internal  combustion engines, electric tools and appliances, and paper-pushing jobs to buy them. 
到目前为止，它仍然存在于健身房，很可能是因为在现实世界中很难找到足够的外部运动，现实世界中，以前需要体力劳动的一切都被内燃机、电动工具和电器以及购买它们的推纸工作所取代。

The gym, however, is a good place to start before venturing out in the real world and doing real things. 
然而，健身房是一个很好的开始，然后再冒险进入现实世界，做真正的事情。
It's a place of physiological preparation, where real world strength is built up using movements which are similar in form, strength, intensity,  and  work  capacity to  real  world  movements. 
这是一个生理上做准备的地方，在这里，通过与真实世界相似形式、力量、强度和能力和真实世界联系起来。
For  instance,  the  clean and  jerk  corresponds  to  picking  up  an  unconscious  person,  the  vertical  row corresponds to pulling a rope, the squat corresponds to picking up a child, and the power clean corresponds to stacking sacks of corn. 
例如，挺举对应于抱起一个失去知觉的人，直立划船对应于拉一根绳子，蹲起对应于抱起一个孩子，而高翻对应于堆放一袋袋玉米。
With a solid foundation in functional  fitness,  activities  like  cycling,  walking,  running,  double  digging  a garden, or doing laundry with a plunger will be quite easy in comparison. 
有了坚实的基础，在功能性健身，活动如骑自行车，步行，跑步，挖花园，或洗衣服将很容易比较。
It'll be the equivalent of driving a powerful SUV, tow-package, hybrid, and all that. 
这将相当于驾驶一辆功能强大的有拖车套件、混合动力等等的SUV。

Being in the right shape means an enhanced ability to tolerate cold, since it depends  on  muscularity  (static)  and  work  capacity  (dynamic). 
身体健康意味着耐寒能力增强，因为这取决于肌肉（静态）和工作能力（动态）。
A  high  work capacity is the ability to perform physical work as fast as possible. 
高工作能力是指尽可能快地完成体力劳动的能力。
Similarly, the ability  to  tolerate  heat  depends  on  a  low  body  fat  percentage. 
类似地，耐热能力取决于低脂肪比。
If  you  never experience heat, you can carry more body fat. 
如果你从未经历过高温，你可以携带更多的身体脂肪。
However, it's easier not to carry it and  simply  add  a  layer  of  clothes. 
然而，不携带它更容易，只需添加一层衣服。
The  proper  physical  conditioning  is  thus aligned with the problem of heating and cooling (see Heating and cooling). 
因此，适当的物理调节与加热和冷却问题一致（参见[加热和制冷]()）。

It's possible never to be out of breath walking up stairs or otherwise engaging in normal activities, like cycling 10 miles to work or carrying a heavy package. 
走上楼梯或从事其他正常活动，比如骑16公里的自行车去上班或提着沉重的包裹，永远都不可能上气不接下气。
It's possible never to be sore after an activity. 
运动后不再感到酸痛是可能的。
It's possible to have fun engaging in strenuous physical activities into your 60s or beyond. 
在60多岁或更高的年龄段从事剧烈的体育活动是可能的。
The reason that people get  weak  is  not  age;  it's  a  history  of  disuse,  a  process  many  start  right  out  of college. 
人们变弱的原因不是年龄；而是一段废弃的历史，许多人从大学一毕业就开始了这个过程。
I  think  that  maintaining  this  functionally  into  old  age  will  make  life enjoyable for a long time. 
我认为，将这一功能维持到老年，将使很长的生活变得愉快。
I notice that my 80-year-old grandmother, who grew up  on  a  farm,  until  recently  was  stronger  than  my  mother,  who  was  a  stay-at- home mom and is yet still stronger than my wife, who writes reports most of the day. 
我注意到，我80岁的祖母在农场长大，直到最近还比我母亲强壮，我妈是一个全职妈妈，但仍然比我妻子强壮，我妻子每天大部分时间都在写报告。
This is despite the ~25-year age differences between them, but it parallels the  progression  of  my  grandmother  using  her  hands  and  a  balloon  whip,  my mother  using  her  hands  and  an  electric  mixer,  while  we  use  a  breadmaking machine. 
尽管他们之间有大约25岁的年龄差异，但这与我祖母用手和手动搅拌器、我母亲用手和电动搅拌器、而我们用面包机的发展是平行的。
This trend is best reversed.
最好扭转这种趋势。
